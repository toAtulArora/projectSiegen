Week 0 and 1
--

* Thursday (May 7) 
  * Landed in Germany
  
* Friday (May 8)
  * Met Ali
  * Read the perspective paper
  * Started reading the next paper (detailed version of the same, with weak measurements and what not)
  * Discussed the perspective paper

* Monday (May 11)
  * [official] Bus pass for travelling
  * [official] Bank account for DAAD
  * Attended Dr. Otfried's class | topic: contextuality
  * Talked to Roope | generalized measurements and quantum steering

* Tuesday (May 12)
  * Talked to Costentino
  * Talked to Nicolai
  * Read about Bohm's formulation of QM and thought of some possible interesting problems
  * Talked to Marius
  * Figured the contextuality business and was dissappointed
  
* Wednesday (May 13)
  * Discussed the following with Roope
    * Contextuality issue and related non local hidden variables
    * Exponentiating an unbounded operator issue
    * Concluding commutation relations from exponentiated commutations
    * Implementation of Causality in QM
  * Read about relation of Aharnov Bohm effect and non locality
  * Talked to Maria and Frank
  * Read more about gauge theories and the Aharnov Bohm Effect
  * Had a short discussion with Prof. Guehne about contextuality

* Thursday (May 14) [off]
  * Read about causality from Aharnovs book
  * Read the historical development of QM from Weinberg's book on QM (the guy I think also discusses contrained systems (Dirac's thing))

* Friday (May 15)
  * Read chapter 5 like one should
  * Discussed various things with Ali (given in the summary document)
  * Tried to think of new ideas to find peculiar features of non locality

* Saturday | Sunday (May 16, 17)
  * Life essentials
  * Thought about non local dynamics and how to construct a test for it
  * Started writing the thoughts systematically (but somehow, they seem to be worthless now)

Week 2
--

* Monday (May 18)
  * Otfried's class
  * Contextuality assumption is not equivalent to determinism | clarified
  * Talked to Zanna about Quantum Metrology
