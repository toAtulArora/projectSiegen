\begin_layout Title
Self Critique: Test for dynamical non-locality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Atul Singh Arora
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Quantum corelations are non local and yet can't be used to send non local
 signals.
 Local hidden variable theories were ruled out as possible theories to explain
 the correlations.
 Tests such as Bell's, CHSH etc.
 have been key to this.
 However, these tests are not sensitive to another type of non locality.
 This enters quantum mechanics through the dynamics.
 Here we attempt to construct such tests which relax the local realism assumptio
ns and probe the aforesaid kind of non locality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Preliminary Thoughts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What I have therefore come to believe is that I must not attempt to do the
 usual impossible, such as action at a distance or equivalently, signalling
 faster than speed of light.
 I must therefore come up with a situation which I know is impossible classicall
y, yet is not a violation of action at a distance.
 Examples of such cases are already known, such as quantum correlations
 (bell's inequality), non-commutativity of operators leading to contextuality
 etc.
 So perhaps then the question then is to formulate the basis for a new test
 in quantum mechanics.
 One that tests something of the aforesaid variety.
 So the question then changes from non locality to that of non classicality.
 One such feature which exists is the Aharnov Bohm effect.
 The close relation between a gauge field and the wavefunction.
 However, I already know that the effect that is observed shouldn't happen
 in the first place.
 Still if one insists on thinking about it further, one can investigate
 exactly what it is that this Aharnov Bohm effect is doing, which we were
 not able to accomplish using usual unitary operators.
 Could these infact be something we haven't looked at earlier and be usable
 in quantum computation in some non-trivial way? Well, after some thought
 the following became clear.
 What is interesting in the Aharnov Bohm effect is not that 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi\to\psi_{1}+e^{i\phi}\psi_{2}$
\end_inset

 (because the analogous can be done on qubits using unitaries).
 It is the fact that this effect is happening due to a field which is never
 in contact with the particle.
 Therefore in my opinion, we have various tests for type 1 non locality,
 which arises from the structure of the Hilbert space (such as states like
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\left|00\right\rangle +\left|11\right\rangle \right)$
\end_inset

).
 These include quantum correlation and contextuality etc.
 However, one must investigate how to test for type 2 non locality, viz.
 non locality in the dynamics of quantum mechanics.
 An explicit example of this, is the time evolution of the displacement
 operator (Heisenberg picture).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So in an attempt to create a test for type 2 non locality, I must start
 with thinking about the assumptions on which to base the test.
 The tests I have seen so far, seem to be based on certain classical assumptions
 about locality and realism.
 They then derive under those assumptions, certain relations between measurable
 quantities.
 These then they show, according to quantum mechanics must be violated under
 certain situations.
 Ofcourse, then experiments are done and victorious emerges our quantum
 theory.
 I could think about various more basic questions, but at the moment, I
 must restrict myself to the easiest (relatively readily solvable) I can
 formulate.
 Recall that I had thought about paradoxes in QM if you apply STR and reverse
 sequence of events because simultaneity we'd just learnt was relative.
 Then there were issues with randomness and how it must be thought of as
 a local phenomenon and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let me therefore attempt to list down some of the assumptions.
 This is already getting tricky.
 Let's start naive.
 (call these set B)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
All measurables of the system have a well defined value prior to measurement
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
All interactions are local (even if there're hidden variables) [so far these
 are the same as those assumed by Bell] 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
NB1: From usual observations themselves we know that 1 doesn't hold.
 The failure of Bell test then implies 2 must be false.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
NB2: The weaker the assumption, stronger will be the repercussions of its
 violation 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to these I assume
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Related to evolution of the system: The measurables are a function of time
 and of the hidden variable, which itself maybe assumed to be time dependent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Idea: At most there're local hidden variables that are allowed to evolve
 with time 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Idea: Assume nothing about the cause of the dynamics.
 Just assume some time dependence 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Idea: Then show that Aharnov Bohm shows type 2 non locality 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Stage 2 will be to come up with a neater set of assumptions, that don't
 assume the Bell conditions, but still assume something that can only happen
 in the quantum case.
 My guess would be to not assume B1 and B2.
 This will suddenly become hard.
 But I think that is the point.
 I must be able to show that it was possible for there to be a theory which
 has the quantum correlations that QM shows (type 1 non locality) and yet
 its dynamical equations are local, unlike those of QM (type 2).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It would then be sensible to say that QM has features which not restricted
 to type 1 non locality, but also has type 2.
 One approach could be to attempt constructing a theory with the Hilbert
 space structure, but with strictly local time evolution.
 Then I can look at the weakest assumption I must make to do this and on
 those grounds, make a prediction.
 Then find a QM example that violates it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Rethinking
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Assumptions of the Test
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What do I really wish to show.
 I want to show that there exists another type of non locality, namely dynamic
 non locality.
 Let's analyse the following
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
Claim: If I start with (all or some of) the assumptions of Bell, then I
 would have proved nothing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
Justfctn: Since QM already violates Bell inequality, therefore it means
 that atleast one of the assumptions in B must be false.
 If my test is based on those assumptions, then it would not be reasonable
 to assume that QM will necessarily pass it.
 Further, if my objective is to show a feature in addition to quantum correlatio
ns, then my assumptions mustn't rule out the latter, from the start.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
Against: One can however un assume the Bell result.
 In that case, this new test will be another way of ruling out non local
 theories.
 It is similar in spirit with the Non-contextuality result.
 It's independent of Bell's results, and yet rules out assumption B1 of
 Bell's.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
Remark: 
\emph on
If my test is based on (all or some of) those assumptions, then it would
 not be reasonable to assume that QM will necessarily satisfy it.

\emph default
 A violation therefore will not clarify the cause; whether it is based on
 quantum correlations or on non local dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Shades of Non Locality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[I'm hungry, but will write the idea quickly] Bell had to assume locality
 in his theory because he had considered two particles.
 In the non-contextuality thing, kroker shpecker (TODO: fix the names) have
 only one system, therefore they didn't have to assume locality.
 It appears to me, that I must go another step in this direction.
 I must assume a single particle/system, and assume locality of some sort
 within that framework.
 This will be interesting because it is in stark contrast with bell type
 locality.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The point really is that non locality now is not about two different particles.
 I want to see the non locality that exists for a single particle itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Criticism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is essentially nothing that has been shown.
 All of these are trivial consequences of the axioms of quantum mechanics.
 Note that this doesn't hold for Bell's work.
 Bell at that time concluded a debate about local realism.
 What is the point of doing all of this in today's context?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Understanding Ali's work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
First Attempt
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the density matrix picture in the back of our minds, we construct a
 more general framework.
 This must be able to easily incorporate a wider set of theories with only
 one constraint; interactions between particles is local.
 Explicitly then, we assume
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Space like separated particles can have no instantaneous effect on each
 other
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
NB: We have assumed nothing about all measurables being simultaneously well
 defined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now one must be careful.
 We define the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 represents the `state of the system'.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This may include inaccessible hidden variables.
 For the case of QM, we'll let 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=(q,p)$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

 is the set that contains all possible states of the system; 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\in\Lambda$
\end_inset

 by definition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(\lambda)$
\end_inset

 is that function of the theory that contains all that can be predicted
 about the system
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This function must satisfy the following
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Normalisation: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(\lambda)=\int\mu(\lambda)d\lambda=1$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\strikeout on
Non-negativity: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu(\lambda)>0$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

With these, one can (not mathematically strictly perhaps) take 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 to be a probability density 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For two systems 
\begin_inset Formula $1,\,2$
\end_inset

, we define 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{12}\equiv\int\mu_{1}(\lambda)\mu_{2}(\lambda)d\lambda$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 in general therefore should be s.t.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{12}>0
\]

\end_inset

for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 that the theory allows.
