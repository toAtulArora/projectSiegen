In the plotWignerForCat,
currently, what's happening:
	   1. for a mixed coherent state, I get what looks like the right result as W (except some imaginary part too, that's expected because even in a gaussian, it gives some small imaginary part)
	      * Is the imaginary part indeed small? Figure it out
	      - Yes it is about 5, real is about 60 | however, the output doesn't look like a gaussian now :(
	      - With a 3d plot, again it is confirmed that the guassians do seem to appear
	   2. for schrodinger cat state, I get
	      *
