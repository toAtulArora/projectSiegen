\opening{Dear Editor(s),}

In this paper we have addressed the long standing problem of \emph{satisfactorily}
extending the Bell test to phase space. As originally formulated,
the Bell inequality was setup for a quantum spin which has no classical
analogue. That it shall possess such peculiarities is therefore, in
hindsight, not very surprising. Antithetically, here we manifest a
violation using highly classical observables, viz. position and momentum.

Our approach is particularly distinctive as it neither requires restriction
of the relevant states to a highly idealized and immured subset, nor
is it effectively, a vicarious reformulation of the spin half case;
we have bolstered our result with an experimental proposal to emphasise
this.

We have been punctilious with the draft and hope that it would make
for a lucid read and wouldn't elicit much editing.

Atul Singh Arora}
