\begin_layout Title
projectSiegen | Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Summarized progress report of my summers 2015 I spent in Siegen, Germany.
 Main themes of study were Modular Variables, AB effect, Bell Test in continuous
 variables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
May 7-13 [week 0 and 1]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Impressions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I started with reading about Modular Variables from `Dynamical quantum non-local
ity', a perspective paper from Nature Physics.
 The paper basically talks about how modular variables capture the essence
 of a quantum state in a way that no other variable we've considered so
 far does.
 It relates this to non-locality in quantum mechanics.
 This non-locality however is not the one usually considered in the context
 of say the singlet state.
 The point they make is that this non-locality arises from the equations
 of motion (Heisenberg picture), which are non-local themselves (since operators
 are involved).
 I found the paper is simple, subtle and interesting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Next I started reading a paper titled `Quantum interference experiments,
 modular variables and weak measurements' from IOP Science.
 This I was told is an elaboration of the perspective paper.
 However, I didn't complete this for I hadn't frozen the topic yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I talked to a person named `Roope' at the group and his work came across
 as rather fascinating.
 I was impressed by his work; it is related to `measurement equivalent of
 mixed state'.
 You make a certain kind of measurment with a certain classical probability.
 With this type of measruement operators, he was able to show that for compatibl
ity, commutation is not the best criterion.
 Of course compatability means that the two measurement can be done simultaneous
ly without affecting each other.
 He gave a good example from his paper `Joint Measureablity of Generalized
 Measruements Implies Classicality', PRL to illustrate the points.
 His main result was unification of the concept of steering with that of
 his test of joint measurement, viz.
 compatibility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Modular variables are discussed quite neatly in the book by Aharonov et.
 al., titled `Quantm Paradoxes: Quantum Theory for the Perplexed'.
 I read the first few pages, which are a delight to read (about how paradoxes
 help, classification of paradoxes etc.).
 I read the main chapter related to modular variables.
 I still have some small doubts which I'll clarify soon.
 Other than that, I have a good basic idea of the concept.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I talked to `Costentino' who basically told me that his work revolves around
 looking at Bells inequalities in more complicated systems.
 I didn't find that particularly attractive.
 I also talked to `Nicolai' and he told me he works on finding interesting
 states.
 The kind of states he/they look for are such that the sub systems (partially
 traced) are separable but the entire state is `genuinely entangled' (this
 is the region of state space excluding separable and after tracing entangled
 states).
 He talked about witnesses and an algorithm to find an optimal witness and
 an optimal state correspondingly, recursively, starting from a random initial
 state matrix.
 This was ok, but again, not very appealing to me.
 And last person for the (that) day, I talked to `Marius' and he told me
 about how he studies bell's inequalities in decaying particles, and his
 system of choice was Kions.
 Again, it maybe non trivial and hard, but didn't come accross as worth
 pursuing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Discussed various topics with Roope including
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
How contextuality is expected from usual understanding of QM, but it is
 essential to characterize the quantum feature of the system (later Dr.
 Guehne explained how in Bell's case, local hidden variable is the assumption,
 whereas here, the assumption is non-contextuality [since we're talking
 about only one system])
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Discussed how one can exponentiate an unbounded operator.
 He seemed to have some big mathematical machinary, but I am still not convinced
 that it is necessary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I wasn't able to understand how to prove (especially after the new definition
 of exponentiation) 
\begin_inset Formula $[e^{A},e^{B}]=0\implies[A,B]=0$
\end_inset

.
 We tried some things, but they didn't help much.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Implementing causality etc.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Maria: She works on hypergraph states.
 The idea is to represent quantum states as graphs.
 One can show the limits of usual graphs of this form.
 The limit is that one can represent say the GHZ state, but not a related
 less entagled state (forgot the name).
 She had made a lot of new progress in barely 3 months.
 She found states which maximally violate the bell inequality in 3 qubits,
 which weren't known earlier.
 She was able to even derive conditions on probablities of certain outcomes
 which consequently rule out various local hidden variable models.
 In the course of doing this, she'd made various conjectures and proven
 them, by looking at patterns in certain calculations.
 I found her work rather interesting and impressive, given that she did
 it all in barely 3 months (and that she is/was a computer science student),
 but not something I'd pursue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Frank: He started with explaining various usual quantum optics subtopics,
 such as action of a beam splitter in terms of creation anhilation operators,
 how its action is similar to that of CNOT, how it can easily convert superposit
ion to entanglement, how a coherent state would pass through it etc.
 Then he mentioned what's called a P distribution, (stands for P something
 and Sudarshan distribution) which is given for a state 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\rho}(\alpha)$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\in C$
\end_inset

, and s.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=\int P_{\rho}(\alpha)\left|\alpha\right\rangle \left\langle \alpha\right|$
\end_inset

.
 This he said is more useful in characterizing quantum properties.
 Then he discussed how like in the one qubit case, we have a bloch sphere,
 we can construct similar objects with more qubits also.
 Then he talked about relating 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\alpha\right\rangle =D(\alpha)\left|0\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 with creating states from the extremum state, like 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|j,j\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 by applying similarly constructed 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 equivalents, except in this case with 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{\pm}$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $a,\, a^{\dagger}$
\end_inset

.
 He claimed that the states in the orbit of this group (group of transformations
), don't span the full space.
 He said that mixed states so produced can then be mapped to entangled state
 like was done with the beam splitter.
 The details he said are involving.
 This also looked interesting, but again, not the direction in which I'd
 like to work at the moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Return of Ali
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Read chapter five with a microscope, the way I usually read.
 I came accross various difficulties consequently.
 One of them was the fact that they seem to have shown that if we assume
 a periodic potential and apply perturbation, then the angle of diffraction
 must correspond to that of a maxima.
 Else the probability of an electron having any other momenta vanishes.
 Spent a lot of time reading the first section properly, but it isn't quite
 worth it, it seemed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Ali had returned and I sat and explained to him what it is that I had read
 in the days he wasn't here.
 He said he'll be away next week again for another conference.
 In any case, I explained to him the theme of chapter 4.
 It had to do with the Aharonov Bohm effect; this relates the gauge freedom
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $(V,\vec{A})$
\end_inset

 with that of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 to be overall gauge invariant.
 This consequently shows up as a phase in an interference experiment.
 The important thing again is that the interaction is non-local (the EM
 field is zero where the electrons are present).
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Next I tried to explain to him the details as given the book, but it was
 soon concluded that it is not a very good idea to continue in that direction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
He then described his work on exploiting the relation of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $D(x)D(p)=e^{i\text{some phase}}D(x+ip)$
\end_inset

 to get non local effects.
 He talked about how plotting wigner functions help visualize the interference
 patterns etc.
 and then went on to talk about doing bell type tests on these.
 He has written Phys Rev papers on these topics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Finally, he showed me some work that he had started working on, but hadn't
 completed which he feels is new and can be a good project for me to extend/esta
blish.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Finally, I was convinced that to understand various settings, I must be
 able to visualize, which requires MATLAB.
 Unfortunately or fortunately, MATLAB wasn't available on the computer and
 neither was Marius
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Then I thought of some ideas related to observing nonlocal effects etc.
 No good though.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
May 18 - 22 [week 2]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Monday | Multiple Clarifications and Ambiguities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The contextuality assumption is not equivalent to the assumption of determinism
 [this clarification was due to Otfried]
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The idea is that there can be deterministic contextuality.
 My claim was that if this is so, then it must violate causality.
 The counter was based on an explicit construction.
 The idea was simply that the contextuality can be based on the past and
 doesn't have to rely on the future.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Let's quickly understand this.
 Assume the following matrix of observables, such that along a column all
 observables can be measured simultanesouly.
 Similarly, along the row all observables can be measured simultanesouly.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
A & B & C\\
a & b & c\\
\alpha & \beta & \gamma
\end{array}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
My argument was that if the assignment is deterministic and contextual,
 then say 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 has a value depending on the context.
 However, say I just measure 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and nothing else at the moment.
 Since the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 had to depend on the context, which I haven't picked yet, therefore it
 is equivalently the statement that the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 depended on a future event.
 Which is in clear violation of causality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This is countered by constructing an explicit example.
 I say that say I picked 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 next.
 Eventually I pick 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

.
 Now the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 will depend on the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 had been chosen to start with.
 The context is created by the past, not the future.
 Apprently something called Mealy machines can be constructed which use
 memory of the kind, which measurement was made and violate the inequality
 set by assuming non-contextuality
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Conclusion: Non contextuality is a stronger condition than determinism,
 which is violated.
 Which means that we still haven't ruled out deterministic contextual theories.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The claim that there're no observables that measure the phase in the expression
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle +e^{i\phi}\left|\psi_{2}\right\rangle 
\]

\end_inset

subjected to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \psi_{1}\right|\left|\psi_{2}\right\rangle =0$
\end_inset

 was challenged by the following [this was due to Zanna]
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
One could take each of these through a fibre optic and measure its phase
 wrt another reference laser and find the phase difference OR one could
 shine a third light 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi_{3}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and look at the interference it produces.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi_{3}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is assumed to s.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \psi_{i}\right|\left|\psi_{3}\right\rangle \neq0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in\{1,2\}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This is a serious issue because it had been proven that no moment of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 can be dependent on 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 and therefore (ignoring for the moment infinite series etc.) 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 should not be observable.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
I further realized a crisis in the understanding of the word 
\emph on
non local dynamics
\emph default
.
 I initiated reading (fortunately or unfortunately) the paper titled `Quantum
 interference experiments, modular variables and weak measruements'.
 It does seem to have more detail, although I am not certain how relevant
 and how precise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Other than this, I talked to Zanna and she told me she works on something
 called Quantum Metrology.
 This is built on the idea that under a Hamiltonian, an entangled state
 evolves a lot faster and therefore is a lot more sensitive to the external
 environment.
 Consequently, this can be used to amplify detection! The catch is that
 these entangled states are also highly sensitive to noise because of the
 same reason.
 One work around is that you have say 
\begin_inset Formula $2n$
\end_inset

 qubits and let 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 of them evolve under the Hamiltonian whose properties you want to measure
 (could be a magnetic field say for instance), viz.
 
\begin_inset Formula $H+H_{\text{nosie}}$
\end_inset

 and let the other 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 evolve (without the magnetic field), viz.
 under 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{\text{noise}}$
\end_inset

.
 You can then subtract the results (not being precise but that's the idea)
 and get a neater signal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Tuesday
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Objective was to plot the wigner function for various possible states.
 To this end, I read (like one should) sections 
\begin_inset Formula $3.5,\,3.6,\,3.7$
\end_inset

 and glanced through 
\begin_inset Formula $3.8$
\end_inset

 from Gerry and Knight.
 I covered topics such as
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\int\left|\alpha\right\rangle \left\langle \alpha\right|d^{2}\alpha=1$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{F}=\frac{1}{\pi^{2}}\int d^{2}\beta\int d^{2}\alpha e^{-1/2(\left|\beta\right|^{2}+\left|\alpha\right|^{2})}.F(\beta^{*},\alpha)\left|\beta\right\rangle \left\langle \alpha\right|$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
P-distribution, Q-distribution, Wigner distribution etc.
 and various things related to their derivations which aren't worth typing
 incomplete
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Glanced through the idea of why and how all these distributions are related
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I attempted getting an expression for the wigner function for the state

\begin_layout Subsection
Wednesday
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Continued fine reading of chapter 5 from Aharnov's book.
 It has started to make some sense finally.
 Although I am still not clear about the doubts from last time, the new
 sections (with the modifications such as 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{i\hat{p}L/\hbar}$
\end_inset

 as opposed to 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{ipL/\hbar}$
\end_inset

) have started making sense.
 I also seem to have found a flaw in one of the calculations, where it is
 shown that 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{ipL/\hbar}f(x)=f(x+L)$
\end_inset

 and so on.
 The important point I learnt this time however, was the following statement:
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{mod}$
\end_inset

 (defined always with 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{i\hat{p}L/\hbar}$
\end_inset

 at the back of the mind) is completely uncertain iff (if and only if) 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle e^{in\hat{p}L/\hbar}\right\rangle =0\,\forall\, n\in\mathcal{N}$
\end_inset

.
 If one thinks of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{p}$
\end_inset

 as a number, and the expectation as these numbers occurring with classical
 probabilities, then one can easily prove this.
 In any case, if taken as a definition also (because it is rather sensible:
 it is possible that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \hat{p}\right\rangle \neq0$
\end_inset

 but

 leads to loss of information about the modular variable! This is at the
 very least now makes some sense in doing.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

In my CT I thought about how it is possible for 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{mod}$
\end_inset

 to evolve with time, viz.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle e^{in\hat{p}L/\hbar}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 to evolve with time, but when looked at in the Schrodinger picture, since
 the wavefunction 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 doesn't change (assume the potential to be locally constant), then how
 will 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle e^{in\hat{p}L/\hbar}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 evolve?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Next I tried plotting the wigner function for the state 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=\left|\alpha\right\rangle \left\langle \alpha\right|$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
I used the method where 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\gamma)=\frac{1}{\left(2\pi\hbar\right)^{2}}\int d^{2}\lambda e^{\left(\lambda\gamma^{*}-\gamma\lambda^{*}\right)/2}\text{tr}\left(\rho D(\lambda)\right)$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I converted this to two fourier transforms as 
\begin_inset Formula $W(\gamma_{1}-i\gamma_{2})=\frac{1}{\left(2\pi\hbar\right)^{2}}\int d\lambda_{1}d\lambda_{2}e^{i\left(\lambda_{2}\gamma_{1}+\lambda_{1}\gamma_{2}\right)}\text{tr}\left(\rho D(\lambda)\right)$

\end_inset

 Atoms in a Lattice', 1505.02902.
 This was an experimental paper that discussed an algorithm to initialize
 states and perform measurements to show that there was indeed entanglement
 with generalization of Bells inequality to multiple particles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The next paper she wanted to discuss had already been presented earlier,
 therefore she omitted it (she was away then)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Finally, she made a remark about the third paper titled `Hate and Love',
 1505.04326 which is related to physics somehow.

was able to derive most of the commutation relations etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
wasn't able to understand conservation of modular momentum among certain
 other things

\begin_layout Itemize
Tried thinking about new ideas while was `forced' to attend this seminar
 on quantum fourier transform.
 The one new thing I learnt was that it still hasn't been implemented on
 a large enough system
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Tried proving that the equation of motion (heisenberg picture) of 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{m}p^{k}$
\end_inset

 will always be local.
 Then again got into trouble wondering what it is that the exponential does
 to make it non local?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Idea was to either find other non local equations or prove that exponential
 and its linear combinations are the only ones

Fixing the FFT
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Things weren't functioning so went to the 1D case to test with known analytic
 results.
 The fourier transform of a real guassian was returning numerically a gaussian
 with imaginary part
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The issue was ofcourse the labelling.
 The system was not assuming the origin to be in the centre.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fixed this by explicitly moving things in an array etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
After more struggle, found that there're functions by the name fftshift
 and ifftshift to do just that (except that I thought they do the fft and
 the shift)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Since a gaussian was supposed to return a gaussian (and I had part of the
 translation code still there), got fooled into believing that the shift
 map is indeed the right fourier transform
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Spent some time with putting this in the coherent state code (which also
 seemed to work for obvious reasons) and then finally for the cat state
 which had to fail ofcourse.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Went home and beat my head over it, until I figured my mistake.
 You're supposed to do fftshift(fft(ifftshift(f))) to get the right result.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Apparently I had to do fft2 because its 2d

\begin_layout Itemize
Roope's lecture (2 + 1.5 hours)
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
He talked about how by simply assuming the usual about 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and about measurements being linear convex, one can arrive at the 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x|E,\rho)=\text{tr}(\hat{E}_{x}\rho)$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Itemize
He also had an exercise session for the problems ofcourse.

\begin_layout Itemize
Basically figured today exactly how the knowledge of

 destroys certainty in 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{p}$

, resulting in the old 
\begin_inset Formula $L\sin\theta=(N+\text{fraction})\lambda$
\end_inset

, which predicts the same pattern on the screen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This took a little longer than I had expected, but I figured it in the end.
 Only issue however is the first claim that says if I know transverse 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{mod}$

 because the particle passes through the screen.
 Not quite clear why.

Monday, May 25

\begin_layout Itemize
Essentially spent time reading the NJP paper by Aharnov et al
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
It starts by building on the idea of what changes when we do a which way
 measurement (WWM), in the context of a double slit experiment
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Talks about debates over momentum changes before and after, claims some
 results about how to measure them and so on
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Discusses basic strategies of measurement, the moments and the fourier transform
 approach, justifies how the latter is better
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Talks about modular variables (this is essentially the same as that in the
 book) except that he discusses 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
How the parity operator may be used to yield the value of the local phase
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Explains conservation of modular momentum slightly better than it is done
 in the book (basically using the Heisenberg picture and time evolution
 etc.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Explains the consequence of a WWM on the modular variable
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Justifies why it is impossible to measure these non local interactions
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Discusses how indeed the non local effect may be observed using weak measurement
s
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
<This I didn't read completely, however I read about weak measurements from
 this link [http://quanta.ws/ojs/index.php/quanta/article/view/14] till page
 5 or so>
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Weak measurements are based on the idea that the quantum system is coupled
 to a measurement device, which is itself quantum mechanical.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The usual projective measurements are done on the measurement device (which
 is quantum) after letting it interact with the quantum system
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The outcomes then are used to determine properties of the quantum system,
 with disturbance which can be made arbitrarily small
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Then there're more advanced methods where you pre and post select etc.
 which I haven't fully read about
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Apparently, weak values have interpretation which is not yet fully accepted
 and I was advised not to pursue this just yet.

Tuesday, May 26
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Roope's Lecture(s)
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Roope today discussed how to generalize evolution of states, following a
 similar minimalistic assumption approach
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
He defined Channels and Operations (based on whether they preserve the trace
 or decrease it) as maps from 
\begin_inset Formula $S(\mathcal{H})\to T(\mathcal{H})^{+}$
\end_inset

 (meaning from the space of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

s to that where the trace can be 
\begin_inset Formula $\le1$
\end_inset

 but must be 
\begin_inset Formula $\ge0$
\end_inset

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
He put various constraints on the map and added an extra assumption about
 complete positivity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
He then discussed the Schrodinger and Heisenberg picture in the context
 of these operators.
 The statement is basically that we consider 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{*}=\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{*}$
\end_inset

 is the dual space of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 (in finite dimensions, apparently they're same).
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\forall\, N:T\to T,\,\exists\, N^{*}:\mathcal{L}\to\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset

 which is defined by 
\begin_inset Formula $tr[N(T)E]=tr[TN^{*}(E)]$
\end_inset

.
 Afterwards, during the exercise session, he derived various results using
 just this statement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Then he went on to describe Steinspring's dialation thm, which is essentially
 a statement about how to characterise the most general `evolution' of a
 quantum system, in terms of a unitary.
 The claim is that for a given channel 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon:T\to T$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\exists\,(\mathcal{H}_{E},\xi,U):\epsilon(\rho)=tr_{E}(U(\rho\otimes\xi)U^{\dagger})$
\end_inset

 which is saying that the channel is just a unitary evolution of the state
 in a larger space, which is later traced out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Finally, he went on to talking about the Kraus Decomposition, which characterize
s a channel by giving an explicit decomposition.
 [I'm skipping the details now]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
And in the end, he described a way for testing/characterising Completely
 Positive maps.
\end_layout

Discussions with Ali
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Decided to discuss the Aharnov material tomorrow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I talked to him about the old issues, which I thought I had clarified, but
 I hadn't indeed.
 He clarified in specific that you can't infact measure the overall phase,
 even with another quantum particle (I need to do some calculations to be
 absolutely certain though)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
While explaining the calculations of the procedure for finding the wigner
 function using fourier transform, the error in calculation popped out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Talked about how an ambitious but worthy problem is to come up with a test
 that can probe dynamical non locality, as opposed to non locality caused
 by quantum correlations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Decided that the small achievable goals should involve implementing various
 situations and various tests and see how dynamical non locality violates
 these inequalities etc.

\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left|\alpha\right\rangle +\left|-\alpha\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 (with the normalization messed up though)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The issue was essentially that I had messed up one step.
 I failed to put the extra phase when I evaluated 
\begin_inset Formula $D(\lambda)\left|\alpha\right\rangle \neq\left|\lambda+\alpha\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 There's a phase which I had missed.

Improving yesterday's code
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Implemented animations to see the effect of adding a phase 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left|\alpha\right\rangle +e^{i\phi}\left|-\alpha\right\rangle $
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The maxima and minima must swap when we put 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=\pi$
\end_inset

 and this was verified
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Doing the animations required some more streamlining of the code
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Analytically, the imaginary part should be zero (of the Wigner function,
 which is a result in our implementation, we get after fft).
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
This was not working well.
 The imaginary part was about 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{10}^{\text{th}}$
\end_inset

 of the real part, which is not good at all.
 Worse still, increasing the resolution had seemingly no effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This was fixed by realizing that FT for a real symmetric function should
 be real.
 Now even for my 1D Gaussian, this was not working well.
 Which meant that the gird wasn't aligned well.
 Putting the number of cells from 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 (say) to 
\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset

 fixed the issue! The imaginary part wouldn't go beyond 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-14}$
\end_inset

, while the real part was of the order 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{2}$
\end_inset

.

Talking to Ali
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Building on post discussion with Otfried, the idea was to understand better
 why while the moments are phase independent, how 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle e^{\frac{i\hat{p}L}{\hbar}}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 was phase dependent (phase similar to the one in the previous context,
 further assuming that 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{2}$
\end_inset

 are not overlapping, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi=\psi_{1}+e^{i\phi}\psi_{2}$
\end_inset

).
 The idea basically is that, 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
the assumption, as stated above forces us to consider non analytic functions
 only, viz.
 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)\ne\sum\frac{f^{n}(0)x^{n}}{n!}$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Essentially you're saying that you can't find a convergent sequence for
 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 around some point 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0}$
\end_inset

, viz.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nexists\, a_{n}\, s.t.\, f(x)=a_{0}+a_{1}(x-x_{0})+a_{2}(x-x_{0})^{2}+\dots$
\end_inset

 which essentially means that the taylor expansion doesn't exist for 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

.
 Easiest example is 
\begin_inset Formula $1/x$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
since 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(x)$
\end_inset

 is non analytic, 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(x+x_{0})$
\end_inset

 is also non analytic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
From the definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{p}$
\end_inset

 as the generator of infinitesimal translations, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-\frac{i\hat{p}\delta L}{\hbar})\psi(x)=\psi(x+\delta L)$
\end_inset

.
 If I put 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta L=L/N$
\end_inset

, and apply this operation 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 times, s.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $N\to\infty$
\end_inset

, then I can write 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-\frac{i\hat{p}L}{\hbar N})^{N}\psi(x)=e^{\frac{i\hat{p}L}{\hbar}}\psi(x+L)$
\end_inset

.
 For this, I didn't have to assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(x)$
\end_inset

 is analytic.
 Call this definition 1.
 (TODO: Prove this)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If I assume 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(x)$
\end_inset

 is analytic, I can write 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{\frac{i\hat{p}L}{\hbar}}\psi(x)=\left[1+\frac{i\hat{p}L}{\hbar}+\frac{1}{2!}\left(\frac{i\hat{p}L}{\hbar}\right)^{2}+\dots\right]\psi(x)=\frac{i}{\hbar}\sum\frac{\psi^{n}(x)L^{n}}{n!}=\psi(x+L)$
\end_inset

, which is perfectly valid.
 However, since 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(x)$
\end_inset

 is not analytic, 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(x+L)\ne\frac{i}{\hbar}\sum\frac{\psi^{n}(x)L^{n}}{n!}$
\end_inset

.
 Yet, by definition 1, the RHS can be obtained even for non analytic functions.
 I call this definition 2: 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{\frac{i\hat{p}L}{\hbar}}=\left[1+\frac{i\hat{p}L}{\hbar}+\frac{1}{2!}\left(\frac{i\hat{p}L}{\hbar}\right)^{2}+\dots\right]$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Conclusion: Since 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

(a) the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{\frac{i\hat{p}L}{\hbar}}$
\end_inset

 by definition 1 holds for non analytic functions and
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

(b) an operator is defined by it's action on its domain, 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

it is safe to conclude that when extended to the domain of non analytic
 functions, 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{\frac{i\hat{p}L}{\hbar}}\ne\left[1+\frac{i\hat{p}L}{\hbar}+\frac{1}{2!}\left(\frac{i\hat{p}L}{\hbar}\right)^{2}+\dots\right]$
\end_inset

 definition 2 doesn't always hold.

The general direction of the project must be to device simpler questions
 such as the following, and in the process, come up with more intuition
 to answer the basic question, what exactly is the definition of non locality
 and how can one come up with a test which responds to dynamical non locality
 but not to quantum correlation type non locality.
 The contextuality idea is particularly encouraging.

Group meeting in the morning
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Couldn't understand too much.
 Costentino discussed two papers.
 First was about another way of proving the KS theorem.
 The other was more fancy and related to a specific model of quantum computation.
 In this model, they were attempting to find out what exactly it is that
 gives this method its power (characterizing the states).
 One said it is contextuality, the other negativity of the Wigner distribution.
 Infact the definition of Wigner distribution for the discrete case is not
 simple and universal.
 It had something to do with CSS and magic states as well.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Resumed reading the paper by Aharnov
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The initial parts were almost the same, but he has skipped a lot of details
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The section where he defines 
\begin_inset Formula $O(0)=\cos\left[1/\hbar p_{x}(0)L+2k_{0}x(0)\right]$
\end_inset

, I wasn't able to understand the reason for this definition.
 Moreover, I couldn't understand why he had then defined 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle O(t)\right\rangle \equiv\frac{1}{2}\cos\alpha$
\end_inset

 while according to me it should be a consequence
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
In this section, I couldn't understand how this relates to signalling interferen
ce
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Next he discusses the AB effect and uses a funny gauge to describe the magnetic
 flux.
 He obtains some results in that picture.
 [I am not sure about exactly how he writes the expression for the phase].
 Then he goes on to talk about the same thing in Coulomb gauge, with the
 calculations given at the end in the appendix.
 I was able to follow it after some struggle upto the point where he finds
 the phases.
 Thereafter, when he evaluates the expectation values of 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{imv_{y}L}$
\end_inset

, I am unable to understand exactly how he's working it out.
 I spent quite some time on figuring it.
 I couldn't figure the proof of this statement either: 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{i\left(\vec{p}-\frac{e}{c}\vec{A}\right).\vec{L}}=e^{i\frac{e}{c}\int_{r+L}^{r}A.dl}e^{i\vec{p}.\vec{L}}$
\end_inset

 (I know I left some vector signs) which is apparently used somewhere.
 I also suspect that they haven't, atleast on the face of it, used the right
 displacement operator.
 They should use 
\begin_inset Formula $p-\frac{e}{c}A=P$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $p=\Pi=mv$
\end_inset

.
 This is because as I had figured yesterday, 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is the generator of translations, not 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.

Also, while eating, I started looking at the `50 years of the AB effect'
 seminar series on youtube.
 One of them had this paper explained, as I had found even before starting
 reading this.
 The explanations may not be easy enough to understand from the seminar,
 but with some pictures and talking, you get the idea

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Couldn't do much.
 I thought you could somehow use the AB effect or it's modification to detect
 objects without touching them (like the interference experiment)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I liked the idea of assuming contextuality and locality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I figured there're two directions to think now.
 One is the tests direction and the other is this, thinking of experimental
 setups with no classical analogues, which show some novel quantum feature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I realized that even when EM fields are absent, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=0,\, A=0$
\end_inset

 we continue to have the gauge freedom in the wavefunction.
 Was thinking if this can be somehow used to detect neutral particles at
 a distance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I also thought how radiation is explained classically as a particle accelerating
 (say going in circles).
 I was wondering if we can answer questions like two lumps of a particle
 rotating, with the hope to understand why having angular momentum is not
 enough to radiate (eg.
 atoms etc.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I was also thinking if we can make two particles talk by this gauge freedom,
 instead of one particle.
 Perhaps we can see if there's an analogous AB effect with photons interacting
 with atoms, so maybe then we can detect atoms with AB like effect, without
 touching them.
 That'll be insane! :)

AB effect for Photons: I had this idea yesterday and today I started looking
 for prior work on the field.
 Here's what I found.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
I realized that I had read some discussion on AB effect in Ryder.
 This wasn't although directly related to what I was looking for, but was
 interesting nonethless.
 This is because he introduces some interesting mathematics to describe
 the topology of the space, that is attributed to the effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
One paper (phys rev) which was rather old, and this had this insane idea
 of using a solenoid inside the feynman diagram for photon photon scattering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

 generated in some specific setup.
 This was a nature paper.

\begin_layout Itemize

 of non locality)
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
[after Roope's lecture etc.] I realized that in the whole scheme of AB, we
 used gauge invariance with classical EM fields and quantized particles,
 fermions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
I then started wondering how must one think of potentials, when I am talking
 about photons themselves.
 To that end I looked at Knight and found that in the atom field interaction,
 they choose a specific gauge and then proceed.
 So that's useless for me
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I started wondering about other things such as what must the experimental
 setup be to even investigate the effect
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I settled eventually with the conclusion that I must somehow first see the
 effect of gauge freedom on the atom field interaction and then proceed
 from there somehow
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Then there was Roope's lecture
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
We had already discussed that given a state 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 we had found that we can evolve them through channels or operations and
 then the classical probability of a measurement can be obtained by using
 POVMs as described last time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Today the aim was to obtain the state of the system after all of this has
 happened.
 To that end, he defined a further generalization: The measurement Model,
 and later defined something called Instrument.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The details are there in the notes, but I couldn't quite keep up today.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It may be mentioned here that the instrument part is much like the von-neumann
 measurement, because in this, they consider the measurement operator also
 as quantum.

 basically created to make the solenoids exist in superpositions etc.

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The most interesting aspect was Maxwell's justification for introducing
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 field.
 He was unhappy by the 
\emph on
non-locality
\emph default
 of the faraday induction law.
 To make this effect local, he introduced 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 And so this non locality (if 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is not accepted as physical) goes back all the way to classical electrodynamics.
 This makes it harder to understand the precise meaning of non-locality
 in quantum mechanics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There was also this interesting aspect about how Dirac had predicted that
 the electromagnetic charge must be quantized, if there exist magnetic monopoles
 that we can't detect.
 Infact AB is a non-trivial example of where Dirac's approach proves

\end_inset

 field has physical significance and observable effect.

 The math is nearly the same but the physical situations vastly different.
 Plus he said he hasn't quite seen it before.
 A little search on the net seems to support his claim.
\end_layout

He said this could be added to his paper/note as a physical example for
 non locality etc.

\begin_layout Itemize
Chapter 4 notes
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
This is from Aharnov's book.
 I started writing the full notes, and realized that only the kinematic
 momentum 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi=p=P-\frac{e}{c}A$
\end_inset

 is infact gauge invariant because 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int\psi^{*}\pi\psi=\int\psi^{*}(P-\frac{e}{c}A)\psi=\int\psi'^{*}(P-\frac{e}{c}A')\psi'
\]

\end_inset

 infact, now that I think of it, it is essentially just 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{\mu}\psi\to D_{\mu}\psi$
\end_inset

 so that when 
\begin_inset Formula $A\to A'$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi\to\psi'$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{\mu}\psi\to e^{i\lambda}D_{\mu}\psi$
\end_inset

.
 This in turn ensures that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int\psi^{*}D_{\mu}\psi\to\int\psi'^{*}D'_{\mu}\psi'=\int e^{-i\lambda}\psi^{*}e^{i\lambda}D_{\mu}\psi=\int\psi^{*}D_{\mu}\psi
\]

\end_inset

So that means that 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{\mu}$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the kinematic momentum (even in QFT, man I'm an idiot, didn't
 see it then) .
 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 however is not gauge invariant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I also had some doubts about how Newton's law wasn't holding.
 The electron is pulling/pushing the plates together, but there's no force
 being applied on it.
 I mean if I consider this situation classically also, no double slit, just
 an electron passing by a capacitor, mustn't Newton's law hold?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How is it that even upon free evolution, at no time does any expectation
 depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 (or 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 whatever the relative phase is called) in the double slit.
 In fact this seems to contradict what happens physically.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Ali suggested that in the general repeating case, the eigenvalue of the
 displacement operator has (for an 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 lumps wavefunction), the value 
\begin_inset Formula $\propto\frac{N-1}{N}$
\end_inset

, as opposed to 
\begin_inset Formula $\propto\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[
\emph on
possibly new
\emph default
] The most important interesting thing we did today, we came up with a situation
 where changing the potential like a step function (non-differentiability
 is at the place where the wave function vanishes) plaussibly should cause
 a change in interference pattern, something you would not expect classically
 at all.
 So this might be an interesting way to test non locality of equations of
 motion.
 However, now that I think of it, I am slightly sceptical about whether
 the simulation will pick it.

Hey! Where are you mate? I hope everything's good.
 While walking back yesterday I figured the action of the step potential.
 It is completely trivial.
 And yes, it'll yield a state with that phase difference you said.
 Besides, I realized that this is pretty much what happens in the electric
 AB effect.
 This aspect actually can be explained even without invoking the gauge argument
 it seems.

Like in the case of Schrodinger picture, everything extractable about the

 Similarly, can there be an observable in the Heisenberg picture, s.t.
 this operator and the initial state contain everything extractable about

Was wondering if the rest mass energy in the hamiltonian can be measured
 by a method like this.
 It requires superposition of particles with different masses.
 The only thing that comes to mind, is the W bosons.
 Apparently I'd also thought of asking Marius because he seemed to work
 on particles that live in superpositions, but his kayons decay model didn't

How exactly for a photon, will we add the step like potential? I can think
 of two approaches
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
So the energy is basically 
\begin_inset Formula $H\propto E^{2}+B^{2}$
\end_inset

, can't do anything to that.
 However, we know if we introduce charges, we'll have in the action, in
 addition to 
\begin_inset Formula $S=\int-m\sqrt{dx^{\mu}dx_{\mu}}-F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu}d^{4}x-eA^{\mu}dx_{\mu}$
\end_inset

.
 So perhaps the same old capacitor can be used.
 Question is where and how? Since the where requires understanding of how
 the cat state is created, it brings us to
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The next idea (which) is then to first understand how to create cat states
 (for that also, naively I would need freedom to make arbitrary potentials)
 and then to exploit that method to implement a step potential.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Another interesting direction: The splitting of one particle into two doesn't
 seem to produce the same results afterall! If you consider 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle \otimes\left|0\right\rangle +\left|0\right\rangle \otimes\left|\psi_{2}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle +\left|\psi_{2}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, and apply the step potential, then (assuming you apply the step potential
 to the vacuum also) the results are different.
 If you insist on the representation being accurate, you must supress the
 evolution of the vacuum.
 But what's the reason?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It was almost trivial to see how an atom can be used to create the phase
 we wanted.
 The issue is however that this is not an effect of adding a step potential
 to the photons.
 The effect is similar to adding a step potential.
 So this is not a genuine AB effect setup.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To construct a setup where this emerges, it was concluded that since from
 
\begin_inset Formula $L=F^{2}$
\end_inset

, we get 
\begin_inset Formula $H\propto E^{2}+B^{2}$
\end_inset

, which has no freedom whatsoever, therefore we must include interactions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
For the fermion in classical field, we use 
\begin_inset Formula $H=\frac{1}{2m}(P-eA)^{2}+eV$
\end_inset

 which arises from 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{p}+L_{fp}$
\end_inset

, we must have analogously therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{f}+L_{fp}$
\end_inset

 to obtain the kind of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 that we really need.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This can be justified further by arguments such as `given the field configuratio
n, find the motion of the particle' requires us keep the 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{f}$
\end_inset

 fixed, therefore it doesn't contribute to the dynamics.
 Similarly, we must `keep the charges and currents fixed, and find field
 equations'.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
However, one must realize that 
\begin_inset Formula $H=p.v-L$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 must include even parts that're not varied.
 This I have to figure out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Assuming though that 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{f}+L_{fp}$
\end_inset

 are enough, I must obtain the relevant 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 and relevant 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 and see what kind of charge configuration I can use to construct a step
 like potential.
 So this has two steps
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Construct 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 and find the appropriate charge distribution | one intuitive possibility
 is to use two cavities and place a capacitor in between them

 being closer to the classical result),

I figured that somehow non locality must arise from non analytic functions

 classical effects

If we're talking about dynamic non locality, it must be the property of
 the time evolution operator

The test for non locality must admit two different states, related by time

 linked to the bell test somehow)

Eigenket
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Derived the result using a slightly different approach.
 Instead of requiring both eigenkets to be equal, I constructed the ket
 to be an eigenket of modular momentum and then demanded it is an eigenket
 for modular position, to fix the coefficients.
 This did it.
 The result is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\bar{x},\bar{p}\right\rangle =\sum_{n}e^{in\bar{x}\left(\frac{2\pi}{L}\right)}\left|\bar{p}+\frac{nh}{L}\right\rangle $
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Analogously one can start with 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\bar{x}+nL\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and obtain an expression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To prove they are the same, I took the fourier transform of these as 
\begin_inset Formula $\int e^{i\bar{p}x}dx$
\end_inset

 in the position space and upto constant scaling factors, the result was
 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{\frac{i\bar{p}\bar{x}}{\hbar}}$
\end_inset

 which proves nothing I just realized.
 I must do this for an arbitrary 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and not for 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{p}$

s&index=8 | hilarious, and has gotten me to start liking Bohmian mechanics.
 Together with yesterday's seminar (that suggested that the consequence
 of Bell's prediction is that locality is violated), it seems like the way
 to go.
 While on the other hand, it is almost like Newton saying how can gravity
 act at a distance and Einstein coming up with a mechanism.
 Perhaps the times are similar.

\begin_layout Itemize
Continuous variable bell test
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
So basically in the bell test, there're Alice's measurements, which are
 along 
\begin_inset Formula $z,\, x$
\end_inset

 and then there're Bob's measurements which are along 
\begin_inset Formula $z',\, x'$
\end_inset

.
 The state is 
\begin_inset Formula $01-10$
\end_inset

 normalized, and then the result is that the inequality is violated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I wanted to convert this into a setting where only one particular observable
 is measured, say 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 (I'm obviously talking about spins, so 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{z}$
\end_inset

).
 The question then was if I could find suitable unitaries such that the
 effectively, when I calculate the expectations, I get the same answer.
 The answer I found is yes (rather trivially if thought of geomtrically).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Next I asked if I could make those unitaries act like essentially only adjusting
 the phases of the state.
 I figured that can also be done.
 Instead of measuring 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 and using 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{i\sigma_{y}\theta/2}$
\end_inset

 (with various 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 yielding essentially various measurement settings) I could measure along
 say 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 and apply 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{i\sigma_{z}\theta/2}$
\end_inset

.
 This way then, the working of the unitary is infact just the phase shift
 I can happily do with my continuous variable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Why this was useless? Well, it is deceptively close.
 It is not actually that simple, because now the simple phase shifts happen
 if the state is written in the 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 basis, however I am measuring along the 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 basis.

Discussion with Ali [made quite some progress relatively]
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
He suggested we could use instead of the 
\begin_inset Formula $00+11$
\end_inset

 type of state, 
\begin_inset Formula $(0+1)(0+1)+(0-1)(0-1)$
\end_inset

 type of state.
 Although he himself wasn't so sure, it actually got me closer to the picture
 I had with 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{z}$
\end_inset

 rotating the phase in the 
\begin_inset Formula $0,1$
\end_inset

 basis, while the state is expected to measured in the 
\begin_inset Formula $+-$
\end_inset

 basis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The issue however is that we still don't know what is the analogue of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 matrices and how it must be constructed.
 The displacement operator itself is not the best option.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To that end, I started looking for states that correspond to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\pm\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 etc.
 and realized after an entire day of thinking, that it is not straight forward,
 and perhaps, if one of my assumptions isn't false (that there're only two
 eigenkets of 
\begin_inset Formula $D(\alpha)$
\end_inset

 upto phase/scaling ofcourse) then these states don't span, well anything.
 You can't even construct eigenkets of 
\begin_inset Formula $D(\alpha_{2})$
\end_inset

 from those of 
\begin_inset Formula $D(\alpha_{1})$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I had spent the whole day thinking about things based on the wrong assumption
 that displacement operators only displace.
 They infact, also add a phase which prevents say 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{n}\left|n\alpha+\beta\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 from being an eigenstate of 
\begin_inset Formula $D(\alpha)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
My usual scheme of using 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|0/1\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 states with 
\begin_inset Formula $2L$
\end_inset

 separated lumps also doesn't work if the lumps are made of coherent states.
 Other than it not being an eigenstate of neither 
\begin_inset Formula $D(\alpha_{1})$
\end_inset

 nor 
\begin_inset Formula $D(\alpha_{2})$
\end_inset

, they are not even orthogonal.
 I had infact imagined that states of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{m,n}\left|n\alpha_{1}+m\alpha_{2}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 are simultaneous eigenkets of 
\begin_inset Formula $D(\alpha_{1})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $D(\alpha_{2})$
\end_inset

 while these operators don't even commute.
 Now I am in a situation where I can't even construct eigenkets general
 enough to span another eigenket!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Other than this, I added the operator for the phases, viz.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{z}$

Appropriate Eigenkets of the displacement like pauli operators
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Thought along the lines of displacing states if there existed a number operator
 like object for the coherent state, namely 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{O}\left|\alpha\right\rangle =\alpha\left|\alpha\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, then I could use this to construct something like 
\begin_inset Formula $D(\lambda)e^{-i\text{Im}[(\lambda\hat{O})]}\left|\bar{\alpha}\right\rangle \propto\left|\bar{\alpha}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\bar{\alpha}\right\rangle =\sum_{n}\left|n\alpha\right\rangle $
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The other approach I had thought of was if there was some operator like
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{S}_{\alpha}=\sum_{n}\left|(n+1)\alpha\right\rangle \left\langle n\alpha\right|$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 sufficiently large so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle n\alpha|m\alpha\right\rangle \approx\delta_{nm}$
\end_inset

 .
 So what I intended to do was something like 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-\hat{S}_{\alpha+\lambda})D(\lambda)\left|\bar{\alpha}\right\rangle \propto\left|\bar{\alpha}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 which for sure won't work because you would need something like 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{S}_{n\alpha+\lambda}$
\end_inset

 for each term in the summation which defeats the purpose of the operator
 itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I tried to construct pauli operators using 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{k}=\epsilon_{ijk}p_{i}x_{j}$
\end_inset

 but then that is anyway the commutation for angular momentum.
 Then I realized that I've also gone from 
\begin_inset Formula $1$

\begin_inset Formula $3$

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Read the GHZ paper further, realized that they were using more fancy things
 than just modular operators.
 They were using some kind of binary operators.
 Idea was that eventually, they'll construct an operator 
\begin_inset Formula $[\tilde{x}]_{k}$
\end_inset

 which would essentially yield the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

th bit of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 when acted upon 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|x\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 They then exponentiate such operators and define 
\begin_inset Formula $X,Y$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Z=iXY$
\end_inset

 (I actually never realized that you could easily define 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{z}\propto i\sigma_{x}\sigma_{y}$
\end_inset

 because 
\begin_inset Formula $[\sigma_{x},\sigma_{y}]=2i\sigma_{z}$
\end_inset

 while 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\sigma_{x},\sigma_{y}\}=0$
\end_inset

.
 The point is that when we ask for 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{modL}$
\end_inset

 say, then we extract infinite bits, but they're not really needed.
 For instance my 
\begin_inset Formula $Z(x_{mod2L})$
\end_inset

 operator essentially only needs to know if 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{mod}<L$
\end_inset

 or not.
 So my 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 operator is infact somehow only using 1 bit of information.
 This is perhaps the right direction towards an elegant generalization.

It is interesting he said because first order coherence doesn't detect quantum
 effects.
 For that, one must use second order coherence.
 So if we can show the bell test using first order coherence, then we would've
 captured the effect somehow.

The issue is that the states are

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Expressed as a countable superposition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|x\right\rangle $

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_inset

 act the same way on 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\uparrow\right\rangle $

 and therefore one can readily construct

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The operator that sends

\end_inset

, Parity, is a delta function in the Wigner representation (we proved the
 other way round in the Topics in QM, CM course).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\begin_inset Formula $Z(x_{mod2L})$
\end_inset

 operator also essentially does something similar, (for 
\begin_inset Formula $0<q<2L$
\end_inset

) 
\begin_inset Formula $Z\left|q\right\rangle =\pm\left|q\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, so for certain values, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|q\right\rangle \to-\left|q\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Ok now it doesn't seem all the compelling and its worth checking.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
It turns out that it is almost trivial to evaluate this also.
 The answer is 
\begin_inset Formula $W(q,p)\sim e^{iZ(q-L/2)\phi}e^{ipL/\hbar}$
\end_inset

 upto some signs.
 So it is well behaved and bounded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Surprisingly though, if I don't use the anti-commutation, I get 
\begin_inset Formula $W(q,p)\sim e^{iZ(q-L/2)\phi/2}e^{ipL/\hbar}e^{iZ(q+L/2)\phi/2}$
\end_inset

 which is obviously not the same as the previous statement.
 I'll stick to this because to derive the commutation, I had to make some
 assumptions which I'm not so sure hold.

 He basically wants me to explicitly show that the cause for the violation

So I could start with field quantization for the E, B fields.
 In that case, the 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 field is a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 and the 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 field is a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 However, this is when they quantize in a box.
 When they quantize in general, then they have 
\begin_inset Formula $q+ip=A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q-ip=A^{*}$
\end_inset

 and then it takes more reading to understand how they all relate to 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

, the observable.

\begin_layout Itemize
I also just started thinking, agreed that the Hamiltonian is the same as
 that for a harmonic oscillator.
 That doesn't mean that the time evolution of 
\begin_inset Formula $q,\, p$
\end_inset

 should be given by the Heisenberg equation of motion, or does it? Well
 if the Hamiltonian is correct, then given the right coordinates (q and
 p as we have), it should give the right evolution equations when plugged
 into the Hamilton's equations.
 So yes, in general also, one writes a Hamiltonian first which gives the
 right dynamics and then quantizes the conjugate variables.
 The usual trick.
 (I wonder at times if you could do anything other than the Lagrangian or
 the Hamiltonian, but not now anyway).
 Mandy had explained the rest quite well, about what picture is associated
 with the quantum states and where it's happening in the physical space.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The other approach is that I take a wavefunction as I had, and then just
 evolve it according to a free Hamiltonian and from the interference obtained
 (from 
\begin_inset Formula $|\left\langle x|\psi\right\rangle |^{2}$
\end_inset

) I can explore how to extract 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{mod2L}$
\end_inset

.

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
I remember now the contradiction.
 The claim was that 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(t)^{*}p^{k}q^{m}\psi(t)$
\end_inset

 doesn't depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 for any 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle +e^{i\phi}\left|\psi_{2}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 s.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi_{2}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 don't overlap to start with, but 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is freely evolved, viz.
 
\begin_inset Formula $H=p^{2}/2m$
\end_inset

.
 The contradiction is based on intuition.
 It is known that under free evolution, the wavefunction diffuses.
 So the two lumps should eventually overlap.
 If they do overlap, I expect ...
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Allright, after all this mumbo jumbo and confusion, I just realized that
 I must not try to find the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi,\,\theta$
\end_inset

 and take them as given.
 The point is that I should just choose between 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{1},\phi_{2}$
\end_inset

 (say) and then measure 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 somehow.
 This must yield a value between 
\begin_inset Formula $-1\le X\le1$
\end_inset

.
 Now I share my values with Alice and we plug them in the Bell's inequality
 and let the experiments say whether or not there's a violation.
 The question really now is how to find the measurement outcome of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

.
 I got all confused.
 So for any observable, the axiom is that the outcome must be one of the
 eigenvalues, corresponding to the eigenket to which the state is collapsed.
 The issue is that my eigenkets are not really complete, or atleast not
 the `subspace' (subset, fine) I am considering.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\pm\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 are not really eigenkets and that's why all the hassle.
 If they were, then the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 would be 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm1$
\end_inset

.
 But here that's not the case; 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 must come into the picture somehow.
 Is it possible to have observables who's eigenkets aren't complete? That
 way I have difficulty figuring how to measure even theoretically.
 Maybe the notion of measurement can be generalized in some way here (I
 must get the 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

s as probabilities somehow).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
On the way back, I figured that if I use unnormalized eigenkets of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\tilde{x}\right\rangle \equiv\sum_{n}\left|x=\tilde{x}+nL\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{L}d\tilde{x}\left|\tilde{x}\right\rangle \left\langle \tilde{x}\right|=1$
\end_inset

 because 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{L}d\tilde{x}\left|\tilde{x}\right\rangle \left\langle \tilde{x}\right|\left|x\right\rangle =\left|x\right\rangle ,\,\forall\, x\in\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

.
 However, only now I realized that such states would give 
\begin_inset Formula $X\left|\tilde{x}\right\rangle =\left|\tilde{x}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, which means the measurement will always yield 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

.
 What about the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\tilde{x}'\right\rangle \equiv\sum_{n}(-1)^{n}\left|x=\tilde{x}+nL\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 type of states? These are the ones that were supposed to yield 
\begin_inset Formula $X\left|\tilde{x}'\right\rangle =-\left|\tilde{x}'\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 resulting in a 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

 outcome.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I also tried proving the equivalence of the two representations of eigenstates
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 but failed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
After reaching home, I thought perhaps we can use some other system.
 Maybe we can swap 
\begin_inset Formula $x\leftrightarrow p$
\end_inset

 so that in position space, there's nothing fancy, but in the momentum space
 we have about 7 frequencies overlapped.
 Then perhaps we can simply measure 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 which will be defined in terms of the position operator now, from the screen,
 since I can simply measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{x}$
\end_inset

 and record only its mod (or can I?).

Paradox?: So the measurement axiom seems to suggest we express our state
 in terms of eigenstates of the operator corresponding to the measurement.
 One way to do that is to construct an identity operator using these eignkets
 and then simply multiply it with the state in question.
 The result would be a superposition of eigenkets as we wanted.
 Then the amplitudes will tell us with what probability we get which eigenket,
 thus which eigenvalue as the measurement outcome.
 Nothing new or subtle yet.
 But here's the issue.
 Consider the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 as defined yesterday.
 Now if it is true, as has been shown, that 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{0}^{L}d\tilde{x}\left|\tilde{x}\right\rangle \left\langle \tilde{x}\right|=1$
\end_inset

, and that 
\begin_inset Formula $X\left|\tilde{x}\right\rangle =\left|\tilde{x}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, then it seems that the only outcome of measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 on any arbitrary state, must result in the value 
\begin_inset Formula $+1$
\end_inset

.
 However, we know 
\begin_inset Formula $\exists$
\end_inset

 states s.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $X\left|\tilde{x}'\right\rangle =-\left|\tilde{x}'\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\tilde{x}'\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 has been explicitly defined earlier.
 It's measurement must yield a 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

.
 So what's wrong?
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The obvious thing to try would be to see what we get when we do 
\begin_inset Formula $1.\left|\tilde{x}'\right\rangle =\int_{0}^{L}d\tilde{y}\left|\tilde{y}\right\rangle \left\langle \tilde{y}\right|\left|\tilde{x}'\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 If one uses the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \tilde{y}|\tilde{x}'\right\rangle =0$
\end_inset

 (well this itself is a little tricky, works well only if you define it
 as a partial sum first and then take the limits), then apparently 
\begin_inset Formula $1.\left|\tilde{x}'\right\rangle =0$
\end_inset

 which is bizzare.
 And if one uses the expansion of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\tilde{x}'\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 then by the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|x\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, we get 
\begin_inset Formula $1.\left|\tilde{x}'\right\rangle =\left|\tilde{x}'\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 as expected, but then (fine i'll have to do the calculation to find what
 is the issue in that case) the expansion we get is something like this
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{m}\left(-1\right)^{m}\left|x=\tilde{x}+mL\right\rangle =\left|\tilde{x}'\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 Here's the important step.
 
\begin_inset Formula $1.\left|\tilde{x}'\right\rangle =\sum_{n,m}\int d\tilde{y}\left\langle x=\tilde{y}+mL|x=\tilde{x}+nL\right\rangle \left|x=\tilde{y}+mL\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 If I don't expand out 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\tilde{y}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, then the only operation I can perform to proceed is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \tilde{y}|\tilde{x}'\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 which is unambiguously zero for 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{x}\neq\tilde{y}$
\end_inset

.
 So then the only question that remains is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \tilde{x}|\tilde{x}'\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, which we said is zero only when treated as a partial sum.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\strikeout on
This maybe rationalized by imagining that 
\begin_inset Formula $1.\left|\tilde{x}\right\rangle =\sum_{m}\left|\tilde{x}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 which is basically just a consequence of the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\tilde{x}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is not normalized to even start with!
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Thought: It maybe more helpful to think of measuring the modular variable
 as extracting only the modular part, instead of thinking of it as displacements
 etc.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Basically, even 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|p\right\rangle $
\end_inset

s are eigenkets of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $X\left|p\right\rangle =\cos(pL/\hbar)\left|p\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|p\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 are also complete and well behaved relatively anyway.
 So how must then I use this? [I must eventually figure out the equivalence
 between these but first I must get some reasonable answers].
 Infact I am not even sure which set of eigenstates should one use for such
 purposes.
 In anycase, proceeding with this, let's see what we get.
 Looks like I need to know for sure exactly how to convert between position
 and momentum space.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
As it turns out, there's a paper titled `Nonlocal Young Tests with EPR correlate
d particles' which states ``The position measurements at the detection screens
 may thus be viewed as effective momentum measurements on 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\Psi_{T}'\right\rangle $
\end_inset

''.
 This was again after a discussion with Ali
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Discussion with Ali
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
I explained to him the issues, well the paradox stated above (there are
 mistakes in the results there, scaling).
 Obviously things looked spooky.
 I told him why I thought that a measurement on the screen shouldn't work
 (
\begin_inset Formula $[x,p_{mod}]\neq0$
\end_inset

) and was trying to construct the right set of eigenstates etc.
 He however he insisted I must extract this information off of the screen.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
He explained the idea of how he used coupling with spin to evaluate 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \sigma\otimes\sigma\right\rangle =\frac{1}{4}\left\langle D\otimes D\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 as a way of measuring the correlated expectation value of the system (in
 his contextuality paper).
 Point being twofold (he didn't say it explicitly like this, but he has
 some crazy good intuition)
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Recall that for 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi=\psi_{1}+e^{i\phi}\psi_{2}$
\end_inset

, when you evaluate 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi^{*}\psi$
\end_inset

 it doesn't depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 if observed when 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{2}$
\end_inset

 don't overlap.
 However the modular momentum does at that time.
 This 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 dependence re-emerges when 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{i}$
\end_inset

 overlap finally.
 The point is that the information you thought you can't get from the screen,
 you can.
 Somehow the modular momentum information is contained in the position measureme
nt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Next, note that for a product state like 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle \left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle +e^{i\phi}\left|\psi_{2}\right\rangle \left|\psi_{2}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, you won't see interference on the screen of either observers.
 This is because you're left with a mixed state, after you trace out the
 other system.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle \left\langle \psi_{1}\right|+\left|\psi_{2}\right\rangle \left\langle \psi_{2}\right|$
\end_inset

.
 If you however calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $P(x,y)=\psi(x,y)^{*}\psi(x,y)$
\end_inset

, you'll see the 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 dependence re-emerges, depending on again, the overlap condition.
 So basically, the modular variable expectation you evaluated, which depended
 on this 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

, viz.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle X\otimes U^{\dagger}XU\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 should be in some form present in the 
\begin_inset Formula $(x,y)$
\end_inset

 correlation.
 This is what you have to extract.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Remark: It maybe mentioned that it is important to get the scaling factors
 right between this expectation and expectation of the modular variables,
 because that is crucial for the violation, if we intent to measure the
 modular variables indirectly.

\begin_layout Itemize
[
\emph on
figured how to implement measurement
\emph default
] So I finally figured out exactly how one can measure the modular momentum
 off of the screen.
 The essential idea is that you keep the screen far enough so that the free
 evolution can be approximated by a simple fourier transform.
 Consequence is that if the experimentally obtained probability 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\text{screen}}(x_{1},x_{2})\left|\psi_{\text{screen}}(x_{1},x_{2})\right|^{2}\propto\left|\varphi_{\text{grating}}(p_{1},p_{2})\right|^{2}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}\propto x_{i}$
\end_inset

 and the constant depends on masses and the time for which it is evolved.
 In any case, with that information, one simply needs to plugin the value
 of the modular variable and we're done for the evening.
 Besides, one can just take the modular screen position and that itself
 should suffice.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Even though this is not a new/novel result, the point is that it was needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
With that big piece in place, it only remains to figure out how to construct
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\pm\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 entangled state from the EPR state.
 To that end, it was found that after the simplification, the state in the
 Young's paper and our paper are very distinct.
 Need to figure out if it is even possible to do this.

How to construct the state
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Concluded that from the EPR state and using just a grating, the results
 will not be favourable.
 Explicitly tried for even 
\begin_inset Formula $n=2$
\end_inset

 and found that cross terms just can't be contained if I'm using the EPR
 state with a grating.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Started reading about the Quantum Talbot Effect and near field grating effects
 (as opposed to keeping the screen far away, you observe close to the grating).
 Spent some time on figuring out the details about this paper by `Farias'
 titled `Quantum Information Processing by Weaving Quantum Talbot Carpets'
 but that didn't work out very well.
 This still seems like the last resort as the paper claims to do some universal
 unitaries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Discussion with Ali
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Other than the usual attempts, he suggested using two gratings (near field
 like) but then that would probably take longer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Next he concluded that perhaps just finding some mathematical operators
 that can starting from some entangled state (such as EPR hopefully) produce
 the desired state.
 [hold on, what about symmetrized and anti-symmetrized wavefunctions! in
 the case of spins, that's what create the entangled states naturally.
 Therefore I would suspect that symmetrization etc.
 must have some role to play even with continuous variables]

There're two directions, either I can put in more work and publish in a
 better journal (even PRL he was convinced) or I spend time polishing this
 (he said writing a paper takes half the time it took to come up with the
 result in the first place) since I have roughly only a month.
 Either ways, he said the entangled state creation will keep going in the
 back of my mind while I fix everything.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Remark about my writeup: It's more like a report and detailed.
 I must omit the known results and focus on the new work I'm presenting.

Read about 35 pages from the quantum optics book by Scully.
 It explained interesting things.
 Here's an email I wrote to Ali after reading that.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

I wasn’t able to rest properly because my mind kept thinking about the free
 evolution problem.
 I re-derived the result for matter waves, but the issue is that I am able
 to arrive at that result without even having to assume the grating.
 So obviously I’m missing something.
 In addition, I was thinking about whether or not I can even extend that
 result for photons, but the issue is that with photons, we don’t quantize
 it’s momentum and position.
 I therefore can’t quite use momentum as a generator of translations by
 assuming the usual commutations.
 To verify my reasoning, I started to read the more advanced book on quantum
 optics by Scully and Zubairy.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

On page 25 it states “Thus it is natural to ask what are the 
\backslash
phi‘s for photons? Strictly speaking there’re no such wave functions! One
 may not speak of particles in a radiation field in the same sense as in
 the elementary quantum mechanics of systems of particles used in the last
 chapter.
 The reason is that the wave equation..
 solutions of Schrodinger’s time dependent wave function corresponding to
 an energy 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 have a circular frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{\lambda}=+E_{\lambda}/\hbar$
\end_inset

, while the monochromatic solutions of the wave equation have both 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm\omega_{\lambda}$
\end_inset

.
 The E and B fields satisfying the Maxwell equations in free space, and
 therefore satisfying the wave equation too, are real and are not eigenfunctions
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $i\hbar\partial/\partial t$
\end_inset

He goes on to say that “the concept of a photon wave function must be used
 with care and can be very misleading.
 However as we shall see, each of the above objections to the concept can
 be overcome”, where he is referring to issues pointed out by Bohm in his
 classic Quantum Theory book.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

I think the best option is for me to continue reading the book to understand
 this notion better.
 In anycase, I think tomorrow, we should talk to Ottfried about the progress
 we’ve made so far and ask him about this.
 I’m sure he’d know this very well.

\begin_layout Itemize
Basically the issue is that for massive objects, classically we have newtonian
 that gives particle, qm gives waves.
 For photons, classically we have waves, qft gives (both waves and) particles.
 So to compare, you must elevate both to a field description and then figure
 the meaning of a wavefunction.
 It's quite nicely given in the text.

\begin_layout Itemize
Still can't find any easy description anywhere, and am not sure how to proceed.
 Pragmatically, since I have a paper with the calculation for matter waves
 and for photons, the classical result essentially holds (that's where the
 whole wavefunction of a photon issue started), plus that same paper tells
 you the exact relation, therefore I won't bother much.

Commutation relation

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Ali had an idea about using the Heisenberg equation to get 
\begin_inset Formula $dX/dt$
\end_inset

 and then using that to get 
\begin_inset Formula $U^{\dagger}XU$
\end_inset

 explicitly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
[
\emph on

\emph default
] That idea didn't help much, but I figured I could explicitly evaluate
 these by simply using 
\begin_inset Formula $\int dx\left|x\right\rangle \left\langle x\right|$
\end_inset

.
 Using this and while discussing with Ali, I realized that
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $Z^{2}=1$
\end_inset

, so essentially the 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 can be expanded as some 
\begin_inset Formula $iZ\sin$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\cos$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $ZX=-XZ$
\end_inset

 follows from the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $Z(x+L)=Z(x-L)=-Z(x)$
\end_inset

.
 This is very elegent!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
So then 
\begin_inset Formula $U^{\dagger}(\theta)XU(\theta)=XU(2\theta)$
\end_inset

 and I can even expand 
\begin_inset Formula $U(2\theta)$
\end_inset

.
 So that helps alot.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
I also realized the mistake I was making.
 Just because 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{iA}e^{iB}=-e^{iB}e^{iA}$
\end_inset

 doesn't mean 
\begin_inset Formula $AB=-BA$
\end_inset

.
 I know I'm that stupid [besides if you try to take log, then addition doesn't
 remain commutative as pointed out in the GHZ paper].
 I assumed something intuitively using the spin case (which was correct),
 couldn't prove it was correct so assumed this as a correction and got into
 issues.
 So everything is consistent.

 Since

 explicitly (need to verify it, will do so tomorrow/or on Monday)

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}=e^{i\hat{p}L/\hbar}$

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{Z}=e^{i\hat{x}2\pi/2L}$
\end_inset

 and then 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{Y}=\hat{X}\hat{Z}$
\end_inset

 or some such.
 So what justification do I have for using this funky 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

? The answer to that is that I want to allow the wavefunctions to be physical
 (don't want to use a countable superposition of position eigenkets).
 One neat way around it is 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{Z}=Z(\hat{x}_{mod2L})$
\end_inset

.
 This just works beautifully.
 So I get to have my cake and eat it too!
\begin_inset Newline newline

I want to think about it a little deeper at some point (because it looks
 like the GHZ case where they extract only one bit of information).
 I'm sure there's more to it but not clear yet.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}$
\end_inset

 I don't change because it displaces position.
 So the justfication is that I am treating position in a special way in
 my setup, therefore the operators are such.
\begin_inset Newline newline

Perhaps the EPR would need the conventional 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{mod}$

\begin_layout Itemize

 the

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Just realized that the 
\begin_inset Formula $45^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 polarizer is not infact supposed to do 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|H\right\rangle \to\frac{\left|H\right\rangle +\left|V\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}},\left|V\right\rangle \to\frac{\left|H\right\rangle -\left|V\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}$
\end_inset

.
 That's wrong.
 It basically sends both to the same state, viz.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|H\right\rangle \to\frac{\left|H\right\rangle +\left|V\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}},\left|V\right\rangle \to\frac{\left|H\right\rangle +\left|V\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}$
\end_inset

 (except the normalization of course).
 This is because 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|H\right\rangle \propto\left|H'\right\rangle +\left|V'\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 while 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|V\right\rangle \propto\left|H'\right\rangle -\left|V'\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $45^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 polarizer is simply 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|H'\right\rangle \left\langle H'\right|$
\end_inset

, so that wipes out the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|V'\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 Now it makes perfect sense.
 The good thing is that my result is correct regardless because I project
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|H\right\rangle \left\langle H\right|$
\end_inset

 in the end, but anyway.

GHZ
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Figured that in the 
\begin_inset Formula $N\to\infty$
\end_inset

 limit, one can easily construct the corresponding continuous variable case
 for the GHZ.
 If one assumes a cylindrical space, then also this can be done (just impose
 periodic boundary conditions on the wavefunction).
 What must be interesting is the 
\begin_inset Formula $N\ne\infty$
\end_inset

 case.
 In this case, I must be able to show something like you get some values
 (continuous) but according to local realism, some other measurement must
 give, say the product, of these, but it doesn't happen in experiments (as
 predicted by QM).
 The trouble is that I must have an eigenstate, else repeated measurements
 won't work.
 The moment I enforce an eigenstate, I won't get a continuous valued outcome,
 I'll get exactly one number.
 To keep both aspects, I must come up with something different.
 Question is what? What are some of my guiding principles? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Is it even possible to have an eigenstate of an operator and not know the
 outcome of measurement? Not that I know of
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

So I must construct some sort of eigenstates, such that the operation yields
 a continuous valued, but fixed outcome, depending on the state
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Then I must use some anti-commutation etc.
 like relation between these operators and measure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
But the whole idea of an eigenstate is troublesome in our formalism.
 So what makes GHZ really remarkable? The outcome predicted is in contradiction
 with classical expections (so far bell test also works the same), and you
 don't need to repeat the experiment many times (and bell needs the experiment
 to be repeated).
 So I must come up with something in which you make a single measurement,
 with neither of the measurement outcomes certain, but I must have some
 sort of classical constraint on the measurement (by assuming local hidden
 variables) and then show that quantum mechanically it fails, with a single
 (or a given number M) measurement (meaning all Alice, Bob, Clausius).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I can't quite think of anything just yet.
 So one way to proceed is to understand what goes wrong with the finite
 
\begin_inset Formula $N$

 case and then see if there's something I can do to fix it.

 be enough and I realized he was right.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This formulation is correct because it is here that the question of decoherence

I should simply plot 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle p_{1},p_{2}|\Psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle x_{1},x_{2}|\Psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 since the former will show what kind of resolution is needed.
 Did that, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:psiP"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
So now if I want to resolve this, I must have the ball park 
\begin_inset Formula $p=h/L=p_{z}x/D$
\end_inset

.
 So from this I get that the typical distance on the screen must be 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda D/L=x$
\end_inset

.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $D\gg L$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 will be of usable units.
 The resolution should be then about 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{10}^{\text{th}}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $h/L$
\end_inset

.
 The range as is clear from the figure, should be about 
\begin_inset Formula $6h/L$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\left\langle p_{1}p_{2}|\varphi\right\rangle \right|$
\end_inset

 part has been ignored because it is expected to be roughly constant over
 
\begin_inset Formula $6h/L$
\end_inset

.
 This is because we assumed that 
\begin_inset Formula $a\ll D$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 is the slit size and 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 the separation between centres of consecutive slits.
 This can be confirmed from the fact that in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:psiP"

\end_inset

, both the fourier transform and the analytic solution divided by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\left\langle p_{1}p_{2}|\varphi\right\rangle \right|$
\end_inset

, are qualitatively the same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Note that this was done only for illustration of what we get on the screen.

Played a little more with 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle x_{1}x_{2}|\Psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and found that the phase 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 essentially just introduces a nearly identical mirror in the imaginary
 part of the wavefunction.
 You analtyically have 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\sqrt{2}\left(i\sin(\delta')\left[\left|++\right\rangle -\left|--\right\rangle \right]+\cos(\delta')\left[\left|+-\right\rangle -\left|-+\right\rangle \right]\right)$
\end_inset

 which automatically means what I said.
 Quite nice.

Also figured that this can be easily translated to the theory of diffraction
 in 2 dimensions.
 Therefore the patterns looked familiar (for say 
\begin_inset Formula $N=2$
\end_inset

).

\begin_layout Itemize
In that setting, creating any aribtrary entangled state is straight forward;
 the drawback is you can't do the bell test etc.
 since it's a single particle system now.
 I think this is interesting, but we'll not pursue it for the moment
