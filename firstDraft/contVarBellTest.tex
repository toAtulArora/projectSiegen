\begin{abstract}
We show the violation of the Bell inequality in a more classical setting
than the usual quantum spin, viz. with continuous variables $x,\, p$.
This is achieved using displacement operators, or equivalently modular
momentum and position. Two possible experimental realizations of the
scheme have also been delineated, one uses photons, while the other
is based on electrons.

\section{Introduction}

The Bell inequality is a statement about the statistical outcomes
of a certain class of experiments. The inequality was formulated by
assuming the most general `local theory'. Any violation of the inequality
would imply that local realism must be false. Quantum Mechanics predicts
a violation which has been confirmed experimentally. The physical
situation for which this violation is usually formulated, uses entangled
spin states. Here we show that a violation can be achieved without
having to use spins, which is a purely quantum phenomenon; measuring
a particle's position is sufficient.


\section{Violation of Bell Inequality}


\subsection{CHSH Inequality | prior art}

Here the violation of Bell's inequality for the typical spin case,
is stated in a way that is easier to translate to the continuous variable
case. We first state the Bell test in its modern form, known as the
CHSH inequality. 
\begin{lyxlist}{a}
\item [{Suppose:}] There are two observers%
\footnote{that are often chosen to be sufficiently far away that their measurements
don't influence each other%
}, Alice and Bob. There are two particles, which are allowed to interact
initially and are then separated. Alice takes one, Bob takes the other.
Alice can measure one of two properties of her particle, call them
$a_{1},\, a_{2}$. Similarly Bob can measure $b_{1},\, b_{2}$ of
his particle. 
\item [{Notatn:}] $\left\langle a_{i}b_{j}\right\rangle =$Average value
obtained when Alice chooses to measure $a_{i}$ and Bob chooses to
measure $b_{j}$
\item [{Statemnt:}] $\left|\left\langle a_{1}(b_{1}+b_{2})+a_{2}(b_{1}-b_{2})\right\rangle \right|\equiv\left|\left\langle C(a_{i},b_{i})\right\rangle \right|\le2$
if (a) result of measuring $a_{i},\, b_{i}$ $\in\,[-1,1]$, (b) local
realism is assumed. This result will be referred to as the CHSH inequality. 
\end{lyxlist}
Quantum Mechanics predicts a violation of this in the following physical
situation.
\begin{lyxlist}{a}
\item [{Defn:}] $\left|\psi\right\rangle \equiv\frac{\left|+-\right\rangle -\left|-+\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}$
where the $\left|\pm\right\rangle $ states are s.t. $\hat{\sigma}_{x}\left|\pm\right\rangle =\pm\left|\pm\right\rangle $. 
\item [{Consider:}] (a) Two particles are described by $\left|\psi\right\rangle $,
(b) the first particle is with Alice, second with Bob, and (c) Alice
measures $\hat{z}$ or $\hat{x}$ while Bob is allowed to choose between
$\hat{z}'$ and $\hat{x}'$, where $\hat{z}'=\frac{-\hat{z}-\hat{x}}{\sqrt{2}}$,
$\hat{x}'=\frac{\hat{z}-\hat{x}}{\sqrt{2}}$.
\item [{Notatn:}] The Pauli matrices are referred to as $\hat{x},\,\hat{y},\,\hat{z}$.
\item [{Result:}] $\left\langle C((\hat{x},\hat{z}),(\hat{x}',\hat{z}'))\right\rangle =2\sqrt{2}\nleq2$,
which is a violation. 
\end{lyxlist}
This value can be reproduced in a slightly modified situation.
\begin{lyxlist}{a}
\item [{Modifictn:}] (i) Due to the symmetry in the setup, we expect the
same results hold for $\hat{x},\,\hat{y}$ and $\hat{x}',\,\hat{y}'$
and (ii) we demand that Alice and Bob can only measure $\hat{x}$
but are allowed to perform a local unitary before the measurement.%
\footnote{Note that (ii) is equivalent to measuring along any direction. Details
in the Apendix.%
}
\item [{Explicitly}] then, consider: (a) The first qubit is with Alice
and the second is with Bob. (b) Alice and Bob apply local unitaries
$e^{i\hat{z}\theta/2}\otimes I$ and $I\otimes e^{i\hat{z}\phi/2}$
respectively and then both measure $\hat{x}$. (c) Alice can choose
$\theta\in\{0,\pi/2\}$ and Bob can choose $\phi\in\{\pi/4,\pi/4+\pi/2\}$;
see Table \ref{mesSch1}.%
\footnote{These values are motivated by the $\pi/2$ between $z$ and $x$,
\& $\pi/4$ between $z$ and $z'$ in the conventional Bell case.%
}
\end{lyxlist}
\begin{table}

\end{tabular}

\caption{Measurement Scheme}
\label{mesSch1}
\end{table}


Now it remains to show that this scheme also violates the Bell inequality
(and by the same value). To that end, we state a result. 
\begin{lyxlist}{a}
\item [{Claim(3):}] $\left\langle e^{-i\hat{z}\theta/2}\hat{x}e^{i\hat{z}\theta/2}\otimes e^{-i\hat{z}\phi/2}\hat{x}e^{i\hat{z}\phi/2}\right\rangle =-\cos(\phi-\theta)$
\end{lyxlist}
Given that, it is straight forward to evaluate
\begin{lyxlist}{a}
\item [{CHSH:}] 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left\langle C\right\rangle  & = & \left\langle a_{1}b_{1}\right\rangle +\left\langle a_{1}b_{2}\right\rangle +\left\langle a_{2}b_{1}\right\rangle -\left\langle a_{2}b_{2}\right\rangle \\
 & = & \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)+\left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)+\left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)-\left(+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\\
 & = & -2\sqrt{2}
\end{eqnarray*}

\item [{Remark:}] This is a violation since $\left|\left\langle C\right\rangle \right|=2\sqrt{2}\nleq2$. 
\end{lyxlist}
However, to convert this to a more conventional form, we simply redefine
the angles $\theta$ and $\phi$.%
\footnote{so that $\phi-\theta\to\phi'-\theta'=\phi-\theta+\pi=\left(\phi+\pi/2\right)-\left(\theta-\pi/2\right)$%
} 
\begin{lyxlist}{a}
\item [{Substn:}] $\phi\to\phi'=\phi+\pi/2,\,\theta\to\theta'=\theta-\pi/2$;
see Table \ref{mesSch2}
\end{lyxlist}
\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Alice} &  & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Bob} & \tabularnewline
\hline 
Convention & $a_{1}$ & $a_{2}$ & $b_{1}$ & $b_{2}$\tabularnewline
Angle & $\theta'_{1}=0$ & $\theta'_{2}=-\pi/2$ & $\phi'_{1}=3\pi/8$ & $\phi'_{2}=5\pi/4$\tabularnewline
\end{tabular}

\caption{`Corrected' Measurement Scheme}
\label{mesSch2}
\end{table}
Now we have $\left\langle C\right\rangle =2\sqrt{2}$.
\begin{lyxlist}{a}
\item [{Concln:}] The violation of the Bell spin state can be equivalently
be obtained by the measurement of $\hat{x}$ after applying a rotation
along $\hat{z}$ by the aforesaid angles.
\end{lyxlist}

\subsection{Modular Variables and Displacement Operators | prior art}

The observables admissible in the CHSH inequality must $\in[-1,1]$.
If we consider the \emph{real} \emph{variable} $p\in(-\infty,\infty)$,
then one way of obtaining a bound variable is to use $p_{mod}\equiv p\mod h/L$,
where $h/L$ has been introduced for dimensional reasons. This forces
$p_{mod}\in[0,h/L)$. If I further consider, say $\cos(p_{mod}L/\hbar)$,
then I get precisely the bound needed for the CHSH inequality. I chose
the factor so that for $p_{mod}=h/L$, the $\cos$function also completes
a period. Note that $\cos(p_{mod}L/\hbar)=\cos(pL/\hbar)=\frac{e^{ipL/\hbar}+e^{-ipL/\hbar}}{\sqrt{2}}$.

Next, recall that in quantum mechanics, the momentum that's quantized,
is one that generates infinitesimal translations. Formally, this means
that $\left(1-i\hat{p}\delta L/\hbar\right)\left|x\right\rangle =\left|x+\delta L\right\rangle $.
If I want a finite translation, I can do the following procedure:
$\lim_{N\to\infty}\left(1-i\frac{\hat{p}}{\hbar}\frac{L}{N}\right)^{N}\left|x\right\rangle =e^{-i\hat{p}L/\hbar}\left|x\right\rangle =\left|x+L\right\rangle $.
This operator is aptly called the displacement operator. We must add
that $e^{i\hat{p}a}e^{i\hat{x}b}=e^{i\hbar ab}e^{i\hat{x}b}e^{i\hat{p}a}$.
Thus for appropriate choices of $a,b$, the displacement operators
can be made to commute or anti-commute. In the former case, it means
one can simultaneously measure modular position and momentum (which
is striking) and in the latter case, one can define pauli matrix like
commutation.

The idea was that the obvious generalization for obtaining an appropriate
operator for the CHSH inequality is $\cos(\hat{p}L/\hbar)=\frac{e^{i\hat{p}L/\hbar}+e^{i\hat{p}L/\hbar}}{\sqrt{2}}$.
The action of the operator will guide us in creating the appropriate
states in the next sub section.


\subsection{Violation in Continuous Variable State}

We start with constructing continuous variable kets that satisfy the
same orthogonality and mutual relations as $\left|0\right\rangle ,\left|1\right\rangle ,\left|+\right\rangle ,\left|-\right\rangle $.%
\footnote{Defn: $\left|0\right\rangle ,\,\left|1\right\rangle $ are s.t. $z\left|0\right\rangle =\left|0\right\rangle $
and $z\left|1\right\rangle =-\left|1\right\rangle $%
}%
\footnote{We emphasise that the kets we construct, will not be a countable superposition
of eigenstates of $p$ or $x$ since these are highly idealized and
strictly, not even a part of the Hilbert space.%
} We then construct the relevant operators and finally evaluate $\left\langle C\right\rangle $
to show the violation.

To construct the states, we start with some definitions.
\begin{lyxlist}{a}
\item [{Forgt:}] $\hat{x},\,\hat{y},\,\hat{z}$ represent Pauli matrices
\item [{Defn:}] $L\equiv$some length scale, $N\equiv$number of slits
\item [{Consider:}] A state $\left|\varphi\right\rangle $ symmetric about
$x=L/2$, with spread $\ll L$. Formally, $\left|\varphi\right\rangle \equiv\int dx\left\langle x-L/2|\varphi'\right\rangle \left|x\right\rangle $
where $\left|\varphi'\right\rangle $ s.t. (a) $\left\langle x|\varphi'\right\rangle =\left\langle -x|\varphi'\right\rangle $
and (b) it's spread is $\ll L$
\item [{Defn:}] $\left|\varphi_{n}\right\rangle \equiv\int dx\left\langle x-nL|\varphi\right\rangle \left|x\right\rangle $ 
\item [{Defn:}] $I_{N}=\{-\frac{N}{2},\dots,\frac{N}{2}-1,\frac{N}{2}-1\}$,
defined for even $N$ only (for simplicity)
\item [{Defn:}] 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left|0'\right\rangle  & \equiv & \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{n\in I_{N}}\left|\varphi_{2n+1}\right\rangle \\
\left|1'\right\rangle  & \equiv & \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{n\in I_{N}}\left|\varphi_{2n}\right\rangle 
\end{eqnarray*}

\end{lyxlist}
Using these states, we construct the analogues of the $\left|+\right\rangle $
and $\left|-\right\rangle $ states.
\begin{lyxlist}{a}
\item [{Remark:}] Definition of $\left|0'\right\rangle $ and $\left|1'\right\rangle $
justify the word `slit' in the definition of $N$.
\item [{Defn:}] $\left|+'\right\rangle \equiv\frac{\left|0'\right\rangle +\left|1'\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}},\,\left|-'\right\rangle \equiv\frac{\left|0'\right\rangle -\left|1'\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}$
\item [{NB:}] $\left\langle 0'|1'\right\rangle =0,\,\implies\left\langle +'|-'\right\rangle =0$
\end{lyxlist}
Analogous to the spin case, we construct the entangled state 
\begin{lyxlist}{a}
\item [{Defn:}] $\left|\Psi\right\rangle \equiv\frac{\left|+'-'\right\rangle -\left|-'+'\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}$
\end{lyxlist}
These states were constructed with a partial translational symmetry
which is appropriate to the hermitian operator, $\cos(\hat{p}L/\hbar)$
discussed earlier.
\begin{lyxlist}{a}
\item [{Defn:}] 
\[
\hat{X}\equiv\frac{e^{i\hat{p}L/\hbar}+e^{-i\hat{p}L/\hbar}}{2}
\]

\item [{NB:}] Only in the limit $N\to\infty$, 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{X}\left|+'\right\rangle  & = & +\left|+'\right\rangle \\
\hat{X}\left|-'\right\rangle  & = & -\left|-'\right\rangle 
\end{eqnarray*}
just as was with $\hat{\sigma}_{x}$. In general however, the relation
doesn't hold.
\end{lyxlist}
We have almost all the cards, except for one that allows for setting
\{$\phi$, $\theta$\}. In the spin case, this was achieved by operating
$e^{i\hat{\sigma}_{z}\phi/2}$ on the state before measurement. Correspondingly,
here we define this operator by it's action on the relevant state. 
\begin{lyxlist}{a}
\item [{Defn:}] $\hat{U}(\phi)$ is defined to be s.t. 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{U}(\phi)\left|0'\right\rangle  & = & e^{i\phi/2}\left|0'\right\rangle \\
\hat{U}(\phi)\left|1'\right\rangle  & = & e^{-i\phi/2}\left|1'\right\rangle 
\end{eqnarray*}

\end{lyxlist}
This can achieved in principle using alternate glass slabs (capacitors)
for photons (fermions) to adjust the relative phase as desired, since
$\left|0'\right\rangle $ and $\left|1'\right\rangle $ are spatially
separated. Alternatively, we could also define $\hat{U}(\phi)$ in
its analytic form as
\begin{lyxlist}{a}
\item [{Alt~Defn:}] 
\[
\hat{U}(\phi)=e^{iZ(\hat{x}_{mod2L})\phi/2}
\]
where $Z(x')\equiv\begin{cases}
1 & 0<x'\mod2L\le L\\
-1 & L<x'\mod2L\le2L
\end{cases}$ when $Z$ acts on an eigenstate of $\hat{x}$.%
\footnote{$\hat{x}_{mod2L}$ is well defined, see claim 8%
}
\item [{NB:}] $Z(\hat{x}_{mod2L})\left|0'\right\rangle =\left|0'\right\rangle $
and $Z(\hat{x}_{mod2L})\left|1'\right\rangle =-\left|1'\right\rangle $
viz. $Z(\hat{x}_{mod2L})$ plays the role of $\hat{\sigma}_{z}$
\item [{Notatn:}] $\hat{Z}\equiv Z(\hat{x}_{mod2L})$
\end{lyxlist}
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{/afs/tp\lyxdot nt\lyxdot uni-siegen\lyxdot de/user/arora/Documents/projectSiegen/firstDraft/plots/CHSH}\caption{Practically, the number of slits, $N$ will be finite. The plot shows
$\left\langle C\right\rangle $ as a function of $N$. To get a violation,
we need merely $7$ slits, while with $50$ we are almost at $2\sqrt{2}$.\label{chshViolation}}
\end{figure}


To evaluate the CHSH inequality, we again need terms of the form $\left\langle \hat{U}^{\dagger}(\phi_{i})\hat{X}\hat{U}(\phi_{i})\otimes\hat{U}^{\dagger}(\theta_{i})\hat{X}\hat{U}(\theta_{i})\right\rangle $.
If we assume $N\to\infty$, these can be evaluated easily to be the
same as before $-\cos(\phi_{i}-\theta_{i})$. Thus, the same analysis
as before yields $\left\langle C\right\rangle =2\sqrt{2}$ which is
the same maximal violation, in a completely different setup. If $N$
is not assumed to be arbitrarily large, then it can be shown that%
\footnote{Claim(5)%
}

\begin{eqnarray*}
\left\langle \hat{U}^{\dagger}(\phi_{i})\hat{X}\hat{U}(\phi_{i})\otimes\hat{U}^{\dagger}(\theta_{i})\hat{X}\hat{U}(\theta_{i})\right\rangle  & =\\
 & -\left(\frac{N-1}{N}\right)^{2} & \cos(\phi_{i}-\theta_{i})
\end{eqnarray*}


Thus obviously then, $\left\langle C\right\rangle =\left(\frac{N-1}{N}\right)^{2}2\sqrt{2}$.
If we ask for the smallest $N$ s.t. $\left\langle C\right\rangle >2$,
we get $N\ge7$; see Figure \ref{chshViolation}.


\subsection{Validating phase space behaviour}

In the past, it has been shown that one can arrive at the violation
of Bell inequalities in continuous variable systems. One issue concerning
these is that the wigner function corresponding to the observable
operators, are unbounded. An example of this is parity. Note that
the Wigner function for a physical state $\rho$ has an upper bound.
Here however, we are simply using the prescription to evaluate it
for unitary operators.

We care because wigner functions maybe thought of as a specific case
of the Wigner-Weyl correspondence, which relates classical functions
to their corresponding quantum operators. Thus, in a phase-space description
of quantum mechanics, it is important to show that it is not necessary
to have unboundedness to show a violation of the Bell's inequality,
and thereby non-locality. 

Our set of permissible states is manifestly bounded. We must show
that the observable in our case, given by $\hat{U}^{\dagger}(\phi)\hat{X}\hat{U}(\phi)$
is also bounded. To that end, we note that

%\begin{widetext}

%\end{widetext}

\begin{eqnarray*}
W_{1}(q',p') & = & \frac{1}{2\pi\hbar}\int dqe^{ip'q/\hbar}\left\langle q'-\frac{q}{2}\right|e^{-iZ(\hat{x}_{mod2L})\phi/2}\\
 &  & e^{i\hat{p}\frac{L}{\hbar}}e^{iZ(\hat{x}_{mod2L})\phi/2}\left|q'+\frac{q}{2}\right\rangle \\
 & = & \frac{1}{2\pi\hbar}e^{-iZ_{1}(q')\phi/2}e^{ip'\frac{L}{\hbar}}e^{iZ_{2}(q')\phi/2}\\
 & = & \frac{1}{2\pi\hbar}e^{ip'L/\hbar}e^{iZ_{2}(q')\phi}
\end{eqnarray*}
where $Z_{1/2}(q')=Z[(q'\mp\frac{L}{2})\mod2L]$ and we used the fact
that $Z(x')=-Z(x'+L)$ (omitting the $\mod2L$). Similarly one can
evaluate $W_{2}$ and obtain 
\[
W=\left(W_{1}+W_{2}\right)/2=\frac{1}{2\pi\hbar}\cos(p'L/\hbar)e^{\pm i\phi}
\]
 which corresponds to the observab le (we used that $Z_{2}=\pm1$).
Clearly $\left|W\right|\le\left(2\pi\hbar\right)^{-1}$.


\subsection{Source of Violation}

In the Bell test done with spins, the source of violation hinges on
the non-commutativity of the Pauli matrices. It is known that $C^{2}=4\mathbb{I}+[a_{1},a_{2}]\otimes[b_{1},b_{2}]$,
when $a_{i},b_{i}\in\{-1,1\}$. To obtain a violation in general (where
the first term maybe less than $4\mathbb{I}$), it is therefore necessary
that the commutations don't vanish. This is indeed true in our case.
Explicitly, we must have $[\hat{U}^{\dagger}\hat{X}\hat{U},\hat{U}'^{\dagger}\hat{X}\hat{U}']\neq0$.
To arrive at the desired expression we first evaluate some simpler
commutation and anti-commutation relations explicitly. Let's start
with $[\hat{Z},e^{i\hat{p}L/\hbar}]=\hat{Z}e^{i\hat{p}L/\hbar}-e^{i\hat{p}L/\hbar}\hat{Z}$.
To evaluate it, we multiply the second term with $\int dx\left|x\right\rangle \left\langle x\right|$
and obtain $Ze^{i\hat{p}L/\hbar}+Ze^{i\hat{p}L/\hbar}$ where we've
used $Z(\hat{x}_{mod2L})=-Z(\left(\hat{x}\pm L\right)_{mod2L})$ and
$e^{i\hat{p}L/\hbar}\left|x\right\rangle =\left|x-L\right\rangle $.
Thus we have 
\[
[\hat{Z},\hat{X}]=2\hat{Z}\hat{X}=-2i\hat{Y}
\]
where $\hat{Y}=i\hat{Z}\hat{X}$. Here $i$ was introduced to ensure
$\hat{Y}^{\dagger}=\hat{Y}$, since $X^{\dagger}=X$ and $\hat{Z}^{\dagger}=\hat{Z}$.
Similarly it follows that $\{\hat{Z},\hat{X}\}=0$. While we're at
it, we may state that while $\hat{Z}^{2}=1$, it is not a sum of a
2 state projector and $\hat{X}^{2}\neq1$ in general. This manifests
in the other commutation relations 
\begin{eqnarray*}
[\hat{X},\hat{Y}] & = & -2i\hat{Z}\hat{X}^{2}=-2i\hat{X}^{2}\hat{Z}\\
{}[\hat{Y},\hat{Z}] & = & -2i\hat{X}
\end{eqnarray*}


Further, note that $e^{-i\hat{Z}\phi/2}Xe^{i\hat{Z}\phi/2}=Xe^{i\hat{Z}\phi}$
and that $e^{i\hat{Z}\phi}=\cos\phi+i\hat{Z}\sin\phi$. With all these,
it is easy to show that 
\begin{eqnarray*}
[U^{\dagger}(\frac{\phi}{2})XU(\frac{\phi}{2}),U^{\dagger}(\frac{\phi'}{2})XU(\frac{\phi'}{2})] & =\\
\left(\cos\phi\sin\phi'-\sin\phi\cos\phi'\right)\hat{Z}\hat{X}^{2} & \neq & 0
\end{eqnarray*}
as was necessary. Ofcourse this is not sufficient, however we have
shown explicitly the violation. This evaluation was meant to illuminate
that the source of violation essentially hinges on the non-commutativity
of $[\hat{x}_{mod2L},\hat{p}_{modL}]\neq0$. It is apparent that the
complete pauli algebra is unnecessary for showing a violation. 


\subsection{Advantage of asymmetry in $\hat{X}$ and $\hat{Z}$}

Considering the operator (non-hermitian for simplicity) $\hat{X}=e^{i\hat{p}L/\hbar}$,
defining $\hat{Z}=e^{i\hat{x}2\pi/2L}$ is more natural. They also
follow the desired anti-commutation $\{\hat{X},\hat{Z}\}=0$ and we
could define $\hat{Y}=\hat{iZ}\hat{X}$ to get a more natural generalization.
The question is why did we choose $\hat{Z}=Z(\hat{x}_{mod2L})$. The
cause of this asymmetry hinges on the preferential treatment of position
space. We could have constructed states of the form $\left|0'\right\rangle =\sum_{n}\left|x+nd\right\rangle $
and used the natural definition of $\hat{Z}$ to obtain the violation.
The issue is that this forces me to choose a countable superposition
of position eigenkets as my state. Such a state is strictly not even
in the Hilbert space. In the scheme proposed, this issue is resolved
by $Z(\hat{x}_{mod2L})$ which causes a larger set of physically realizable
states become admissible.

Thus while our construction is motivated by the spin formalism, it
is not just a relabelling of states and operators achieved by a severe
restriction of the Hilbert space. 


\section{Physical Implementation}

We show that this scheme can be implemented rather easily using photons.
We harness the two degrees of freedom of a photon, it's polarization
and it's position to construct the required state. With a slightly
more complicated setup, it is possible to do the same with spin and
position for matter waves, which is discussed in the last subsection.
The overall setup (see figure \ref{fig:scheme}) is such that we need
only consider the quantum mechanical description along the $x$-axis.


\subsection{Creation of the entangled state}

The desired entangled state is $\left|\Psi\right\rangle \equiv\frac{\left|+-\right\rangle -\left|-+\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}$.
We start with noting the triviality of constructing a 
\[
\left|+'\right\rangle =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2N}}\sum_{n\in I_{2N}}\left|\varphi_{n}\right\rangle 
\]
 state. One simply needs a source and a grating, viz. a screen with
$2N$ slits of width $a\ll L$, separated by a distance $L$ (centre
to centre). The 
\[
\left|-'\right\rangle =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2N}}\sum_{n\in I_{2N}}\left(-1\right)^{n+1}\left|\varphi_{n}\right\rangle 
\]
 state can be similarly constructed by using glass slabs at alternate
slits, such that the phase introduced is $\phi=\pi\,\implies\, e^{i\phi}=-1$.
In figure \ref{fig:scheme}, if you consider only one particle, and
disregard everything after the grating, then the setup is expected
to produce a $\left|+\right\rangle $ state, just after the grating.
To produce the desired entangled state, we start with two entangled
photons, such that their polarization state can be expressed as 
\[
\left|\chi\right\rangle =\frac{\left|HV\right\rangle -\left|VH\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}
\]
Their spatial description (along $x$-axis) is initially assumed to
be $\left|\zeta\right\rangle =\left|\gamma\right\rangle \otimes\left|\gamma\right\rangle =\left|\gamma\gamma\right\rangle $.
The state $\left|\gamma\right\rangle $ maybe considered to be a guassian
with $\sigma\gg2NL$ so that after the grating, the spatial state
can be written as $\left|\zeta_{\text{grating}}\right\rangle =\left|+'+'\right\rangle $.
Now comes the interesting part. To produce a $\left|-'\right\rangle $
state, we already know we needed alternate glass slabs. If we had
glass slabs, whose refractive index (given some orientation) was say
$\eta_{H}=1$ for a horizontally polarized beam and $\eta_{V}=\eta\neq0$
for vertical polarization, then we could harness the entangled polarization
state to create the required spatially entangled state. Birefringent
crystals have such polarization dependent refractive indices. Assume
that alternating birefringent crystals have been placed after both
the gratings as shown in figure \ref{fig:scheme} (in the diagram,
they're not alternating though). These have width such that the resultant
phase it introduces is $\pi$. The combined initial state is given
by 
\[
\left|\chi\right\rangle \left|\zeta\right\rangle =\frac{\left|HV\right\rangle -\left|VH\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}\left|\gamma\gamma\right\rangle 
\]
After the grating, the state is 
\[
\left|\chi\right\rangle \left|\zeta_{\text{grating}}\right\rangle =\frac{\left|HV\right\rangle -\left|VH\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}\left|+'+'\right\rangle 
\]
And finally after the crystals, the combined state becomes 
\[
\left|\chi\right\rangle \left|\zeta_{\text{birefringent}}\right\rangle =\frac{\left|HV\right\rangle \left|+'-'\right\rangle -\left|VH\right\rangle \left|-'+'\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}
\]
At this stage, if I were to trace out the polarization state, I'd
end up with a mixed state. That is useless for our test. Ignoring
the glass slabs at the moment in figure \ref{fig:scheme}, we observe
the action of the polarisers on the state. After the $45^{0}$ polariser,
the state becomes 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left|\chi_{\text{45}}\right\rangle \left|\zeta_{\text{birefringent}}\right\rangle  & = & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\bigg(\frac{\left|H\right\rangle +\left|V\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}\frac{\left|H\right\rangle +\left|V\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}\left|+'-'\right\rangle \\
 &  & -\frac{\left|H\right\rangle +\left|V\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}\frac{\left|H\right\rangle +\left|V\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}\left|-'+'\right\rangle \bigg)
\end{eqnarray*}
After the final stage, the horizontal polarizer, the state becomes
\[
\left|\chi_{\text{horzl}}\right\rangle \left|\zeta_{\text{birefringent}}\right\rangle \propto\left|HH\right\rangle \left(\frac{\left|+'-'\right\rangle -\left|-'+'\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}\right)
\]
Now if I trace out the polarization state, I am left with the target
entangled state. As a remark, it maybe be stated that although to
arrive at this result we assumed that $\eta_{H}=1$, which is unreasonable
physically, we can compensate for $\eta_{H}\neq0$ by putting appropriate
glass slabs at the alternate empty slits, to produce zero relative
phase when the polarization is horizontal.

\subsection{Measurement Settings}

In our scheme, Alice and Bob can choose $\phi\in\{\phi_{1},\phi_{2}\}$
and $\theta\in\{\theta_{1},\theta_{2}\}$ respectively. To implement
this, we note that the action of $\hat{U}(\theta)$ is to introduce
a phase difference between the $\left|0'\right\rangle $ and $\left|1'\right\rangle $
states. By construction, $\left|0'\right\rangle $ and $\left|1'\right\rangle $
are spatially disjoint; thus the operation of $\hat{U}(\theta)$ can
be implemented by simply placing alternating glass slabs at the slits,
with widths such that $\left|0'\right\rangle \to e^{i\theta/2}\left|0'\right\rangle $
and $\left|1'\right\rangle \to e^{-i\theta/2}\left|1'\right\rangle $.
The same operation maybe done for $\hat{U}(\phi)$ for the second
particle. In the overall scheme, as shown in figure \ref{fig:scheme},
this is done by the glass slabs right after the birefringent crystals.


\subsection{Measurement}

The scheme requires us to evaluate the expectation value of $\hat{X}\otimes\hat{X}$
(after the measurement settings have been applied by the appropriate
unitaries). If from the experiment, we can obtain the probability
$\left|\left\langle p'_{A},p'_{B}|\psi'_{f}\right\rangle \right|^{2}$,
then evaluating $\left\langle \hat{X}\otimes\hat{X}\right\rangle =\left\langle \cos(pL/\hbar)\otimes\cos(pL/\hbar)\right\rangle $
simply amounts to $\int dp'_{A}dp'_{B}\cos(p'_{A}L/\hbar)\cos(p'_{B}L/\hbar)\left|\left\langle p'_{A},p'_{B}|\psi'_{f}\right\rangle \right|^{2}$.
Here $f$ is used to index which of the four possible measurement
settings was used. 

Therefore it is sufficient to explain how to obtain the joint momentum
probability distribution from the experiment, for a given measurement
setting. We start with stating the result that 
\[
\left|\left\langle x'_{A},x'_{B}|\psi'_{f\,\text{screen}}\right\rangle \right|^{2}\propto\left|\left\langle p'_{A}=\frac{p_{z}x'_{A}}{D},p'_{B}=\frac{p_{z}x'_{B}}{D}|\psi'_{f}\right\rangle \right|^{2}
\]
 where $\left|\psi'_{f\,\text{screen}}\right\rangle $ is the state
of the system at the screen, $D$ is the distance between the gratings
and the screens and $p_{z}$ is the $z$ component of momentum of
the particle. For a photon, $p_{z}=h/\lambda$ while for an electron,
$p_{z}=m_{e}D/T$, where $T$ is the time taken to arrive at the screen
from the grating. The idea is simply that the momentum distribution
at the grating can be recovered by observing the spatial distribution
at a screen, sufficiently far away.

In an experiment then, there are two possibilities. \\
(a) Given $f$, Alice and Bob both note the position at which they
obtain their particle. After repeating the experiment sufficiently
many times, they share their list to create a sequence $\{\left(x{}_{A}^{(i)},x_{B}^{(i)}\right)\}$.
From this sequence, they create a 2D histogram, by simply counting
how many time they got $(x'_{A},x'_{B})$ to lie inside a given cell.
The normalized result is essentially $\left|\left\langle x'_{A},x'_{B}|\psi'_{f\,\text{screen}}\right\rangle \right|^{2}$
from which $\left\langle X\otimes X\right\rangle $ can be computed
as discussed. $f$ is changed to evaluate all the 4 terms to finally
obtain $\left\langle C\right\rangle $ experimentally. \\
(b) The other simpler and direct possibility is that Alice and Bob
both obtain the position, $\{x_{A}^{(i)},x_{B}^{(i)}\}$ for the $i$th
repetition and evaluate $\cos(p_{A}^{(i)}L/\hbar)$ and $\cos(p_{B}^{(i)}L/\hbar)$.
After sufficient iterations, they exchange their observations to simply
evaluate the average, viz. 
\[
\frac{\sum_{i}\cos(p_{A}^{(i)}L/\hbar)\cos(p_{B}^{(i)}L/\hbar)}{\sum_{i}}=\left\langle C\right\rangle 
\]



\section{Conclusion}

We have shown how to realize a Bell test in continuous variables position
and momentum using specifically chosen and physically realizable states.
In addition it has been demonstrated that the exact pauli commutation
relations aren't necessary to capture the essence of non-locality;
infact by relaxing the similarity, the set of states that show a violation
is made considerably larger.


\section{Appendix}


\subsection*{Remarks}

Illustration(1): 

This is trival if one uses the Bloch sphere picture. Instead of measuring
along an arbitrary axis, we rotate the Bloch sphere appropriately,
and then measure $x$. To illustrate this, consider
\begin{lyxlist}{a}
\item [{Questn:}] $\exists\,\text{a}\, U,\, s.t.\,\text{if}\,\left|\chi\right\rangle \to\left|\chi'\right\rangle =U\left|\chi\right\rangle \,\mbox{\text{then}\,}\left\langle \chi\left|x\right|\chi\right\rangle =\left\langle \chi'\left|y\right|\chi'\right\rangle $?
\\
Explicitly, we have 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y & = & U^{\dagger}xU=e^{-iz\theta/2}xe^{iz\theta/2}\\
 & = & xe^{iz\theta}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 & 1\\
1 & 0
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{cc}
e^{i\theta} & 0\\
0 & e^{-i\theta}
\end{array}\right]\\
 & = & \left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 & -i\\
i & 0
\end{array}\right]
\end{eqnarray*}
for $\theta=\pi/2$ as one would guess geometrically. 
\end{lyxlist}

\subsection*{Proofs}
\begin{lyxlist}{a}
\item [{Claim(1):}] If$\left|\psi\right\rangle \equiv\frac{\left|+-\right\rangle -\left|-+\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}$,
then$\left|\psi\right\rangle =\frac{\left|10\right\rangle -\left|01\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}$
\item [{Proof:}] Trivial.
\item [{Claim(2):}] $\left\langle x\otimes x\right\rangle =-1$, for $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
in Claim(1)
\item [{Proof:}] Trivial
\item [{Claim(3):}] $\left\langle e^{-iz\theta/2}xe^{iz\theta/2}\otimes e^{-iz\phi/2}xe^{iz\phi/2}\right\rangle =-\cos(\phi-\theta)$
\item [{Proof:}] 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{LHS} & = & \left\langle xe^{-iz\theta}\otimes xe^{iz\phi}\right\rangle \\
 & = & \left[\frac{\left\langle 10\right|-\left\langle 01\right|}{\sqrt{2}}\right]\left[xe^{iz\theta}\otimes xe^{iz\phi}\right]\left[\frac{\left|10\right\rangle -\left|01\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}\right]\\
 & = & \left\langle \psi\right|x\otimes x\\
 &  & \Bigg[\frac{e^{i\left(\phi-\theta\right)}\left(\frac{\left|+\right\rangle -\left|-\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}\right)\left(\frac{\left|+\right\rangle +\left|-\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}\right)}{\sqrt{2}}\\
 &  & -\frac{e^{-i\left(\phi-\theta\right)}\left(\frac{\left|+\right\rangle +\left|-\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}\right)\left(\frac{\left|+\right\rangle -\left|-\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}\right)}{\sqrt{2}}\Bigg]
\end{eqnarray*}
We define, $\delta\equiv\phi-\theta$ and using claim(1), it follows
that only terms like $\left|+-\right\rangle $ or $\left|-+\right\rangle $;
so
\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{LHS} & = & \left\langle \psi\right|x\otimes x\\
 &  & \left[\frac{e^{i\delta}\left(\frac{\left|+-\right\rangle -\left|-+\right\rangle }{2}\right)-e^{-i\delta}\left(\frac{-\left|+-\right\rangle +\left|-+\right\rangle }{2}\right)}{\sqrt{2}}\right]\\
 & = & \left\langle \psi\right|x\otimes x\left[\frac{e^{i\delta}\left(\frac{\left|\psi\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}\right)+e^{-i\delta}\left(\frac{\left|\psi\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}\right)}{\sqrt{2}}\right]\\
 & =- & \frac{e^{i\delta}+e^{-i\delta}}{2}\\
 & =- & \cos(\phi-\theta)
\end{eqnarray*}
where we've used claim(2).
\item [{Claim(4):}] With definitions from section 3, without taking the
large $N$ limit,\\
$\left\langle +'\left|X\right|+'\right\rangle =\frac{N-1}{N}$, $\left\langle -'\left|X\right|-'\right\rangle =-\frac{N-1}{N}$\\
$\left\langle 0'\left|X\right|0'\right\rangle =0$, $\left\langle 1'\left|X\right|1'\right\rangle =0$\\
$\left\langle 1'\left|X\right|0'\right\rangle =\frac{\frac{N-1}{N}+\frac{N}{N}}{2}=\frac{2N-1}{2N}=\left\langle 0'\left|X\right|1'\right\rangle $\\
$\left\langle -\left|X\right|+\right\rangle =\frac{-\left\langle 1\left|X\right|0\right\rangle +\left\langle 0\left|X\right|1\right\rangle }{2}=0=\left\langle +\left|X\right|-\right\rangle $\\
$\left\langle \psi\left|X\otimes X\right|\psi\right\rangle =\frac{\left\langle +\left|X\right|+\right\rangle \left\langle -\left|X\right|-\right\rangle +\left\langle -\left|X\right|-\right\rangle \left\langle +\left|X\right|+\right\rangle }{2}=-\left(\frac{N-1}{N}\right)^{2}$
\item [{Proof:}] Trivial.
\item [{Claim(5):}] $\left\langle U^{\dagger}(\phi_{i})XU(\phi_{i})\otimes U^{\dagger}(\theta_{i})XU(\theta_{i})\right\rangle =-\left(\frac{N-1}{N}\right)^{2}\cos(\phi_{i}-\theta_{i})$
\item [{Proof:}] We start with defining $\phi\equiv\phi_{i}$ , $\theta\equiv\theta_{i}$,
$\delta\equiv\phi-\theta$, $\delta'\equiv\delta/2$. Next, we note
that $\text{LHS}=\left\langle \Psi'\left|X\otimes X\right|\Psi'\right\rangle $
where $\left|\Psi'\right\rangle =U(\phi_{i})\otimes U(\theta_{i})\left|\Psi\right\rangle $.
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left|\Psi'\right\rangle  & = & \frac{e^{i\delta'}}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\frac{\left|+'\right\rangle -\left|-'\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}\right)\left(\frac{\left|+'\right\rangle +\left|-'\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}\right)\\
 &  & -\frac{e^{-i\delta'}}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\frac{\left|+'\right\rangle +\left|-'\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}\right)\left(\frac{\left|+'\right\rangle -\left|-'\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}\right)\\
 & = & \frac{e^{i\delta'}}{2\sqrt{2}}\left(\left|+'+'\right\rangle +\left|+'-'\right\rangle -\left|-'+'\right\rangle -\left|-'-'\right\rangle \right)\\
 &  & -\frac{e^{-i\delta'}}{2\sqrt{2}}\left(\left|+'+'\right\rangle -\left|+'-'\right\rangle +\left|-'+'\right\rangle -\left|-'-'\right\rangle \right)\\
 & = & \frac{e^{i\delta'}-e^{-i\delta'}}{2\sqrt{2}}\left|+'+'\right\rangle +\frac{e^{i\delta'}+e^{-i\delta'}}{2\sqrt{2}}\left|+'-'\right\rangle \\
 &  & -\left(\frac{e^{i\delta'}+e^{-i\delta'}}{2\sqrt{2}}\right)\left|-'+'\right\rangle -\left(\frac{e^{i\delta'}-e^{-i\delta'}}{2\sqrt{2}}\right)\left|-'-'\right\rangle 
\end{eqnarray*}
Now using claim(4), we have
\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{LHS} & = & \left\langle \Psi'\left|X\otimes X\right|\Psi'\right\rangle \\
 & = & \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{N-1}{N}\right)^{2}\Bigg[\left|\frac{e^{i\delta'}-e^{-i\delta'}}{2}\right|^{2}\\
 &  & -\left|\frac{e^{i\delta'}+e^{-i\delta'}}{2}\right|^{2}-\left|\frac{e^{i\delta'}+e^{-i\delta'}}{2}\right|^{2}\\
 &  & +\left|\frac{e^{i\delta'}-e^{-i\delta'}}{2}\right|^{2}\Bigg]\\
 & = & -\left(\frac{N-1}{N}\right)^{2}\frac{1}{2}\left[2\left(\cos^{2}\delta/2-\sin^{2}\delta/2\right)\right]\\
 & = & -\left(\frac{N-1}{N}\right)^{2}\cos\left(\delta\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

\item [{Claim(8):}] Action of $\hat{x}_{mod2L}$ can be defined explicitly
\item [{Proof:}] $\hat{x}_{mod2L}\equiv\int dx'x'_{mod2L}\left|x'\right\rangle \left\langle x'\right|$.
To arrive at this more carefully, consider the operator $e^{i\hat{x}\frac{2\pi}{2L}}$.
Note that $e^{i\hat{x}\frac{2\pi}{2L}}\left|x'\right\rangle =e^{ix'\frac{2\pi}{2L}}\left|x'\right\rangle =e^{ix'_{mod2L}\frac{2\pi}{2L}}\left|x'\right\rangle $.
Thus, $\hat{x}_{mod2L}\left|x'\right\rangle =x'_{mod2L}\left|x'\right\rangle $,
consequently on the most general state $\left|f\right\rangle \equiv\int dx'f_{x'}\left|x'\right\rangle $
then, we'd have $\hat{x}_{mod2L}\left|f\right\rangle =\int dx'f_{x'}x'_{mod2L}\left|x'\right\rangle $. 
\item [{Remark:}] One needn't necessarily consider eigenstates of $\hat{x}$
to define the action. Eigenstates of $e^{i\hat{x}\frac{2\pi}{2L}}$
maybe considered instead; they can be expressed as (a) $\left|\varphi\right\rangle ,\, s.t.\,\left\langle p+\frac{h}{2L}|\varphi\right\rangle =\left\langle p|\varphi\right\rangle ,\,\forall\, p\in\mathbb{R}$
or (b) $\left|\bar{x}\right\rangle \propto\sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}\left|\bar{x}+n2L\right\rangle $.
Using the second expression, we have $e^{i\hat{x}\frac{2\pi}{2L}}\left|\bar{x}\right\rangle =e^{i\bar{x}\frac{2\pi}{2L}}\left|\bar{x}\right\rangle $.
Thus on a more general state, $\left|c\right\rangle \equiv\int_{0}^{2L}d\bar{x}c_{\bar{x}}\left|\bar{x}\right\rangle $,
we have $\hat{x}_{mod2L}\left|c\right\rangle =\int_{0}^{2L}d\bar{x}c_{\bar{x}}\bar{x}\left|\bar{x}\right\rangle $. \end{lyxlist}
