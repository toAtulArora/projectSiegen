\begin{abstract}
We show the violation of the Bell inequality in a more classical setting
than the usual quantum spin, viz. with continuous variables $x,\, p$.
This is achieved using displacement operators, or equivalently modular
momentum and position. Two possible experimental realizations of the
scheme have also been delineated, one uses photons, while the other
is based on electrons.

\section{Introduction}


In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen 
argued in a thought experiment that the quantum-mechanical description of 
physical reality is not complete, and thus may be superseded by a more 
complete realistic theory which reproduces the quantum mechanical predictions, and 
at the same time, obeys the locality condition.
\cite{EPR}. In his groundbreaking paper in 1964 \cite{Bell}  
Bell derived an experimentally testable inequality, which
bounds the correlations between bipartite measurements
for any such local hidden-variable theory, but which is violated
by quantum mechanics. This was a major breakthrough towards empirical 
tests of quantum mechanics as apposed to common sense theories. Since 
then, the results constraining the permissible types of hidden variable 
models of quantum mechanics have attracted much attention and have been 
reformulated as the problem of contextual measurements by Kochen and 
Specker~\cite{Kochen} and in terms of temporal correlations by Leggett 
and Garg~\cite{LG85}. Today, these concepts have mainly been formulated for intrinsic quantum degree of freedom of microscopic particles such as spins ... and tested in various 
experiments with photons~\cite{Aspect1999}, ions~\cite{Roos09}, impurity spins~\cite{WaldherrPRL2011,KneeNatComm2012} or superconducting 
qubits~\cite{Palacios-LaloyNatPhys2010}. All experimental observations confirmed the validity of quantum nonlocality on this level. 
 
It is, however, more tempting to formulate analogous tests for truly spatial degree of freedom and test the nonlocality in phase space as a natural extension to macroscopic local realism tests [ ]. That's why, the original EPR argument uses phase space descriptions to better address the locality problem of quantum mechanics in such manifold. 
Moreover, phase space is a natural concept in classical theory and it is equivalent to the state space.   The outstanding challenge is to come up with local realism test which verify or disprove quantum mechanics predictions also with most ``classical-like" measurements and operations in phase space.

The paper is organized as follows.
In Sec. we introduce our framework for Bell nonlocality test aiming to use most classical-like variables and measurements, and thus pave the way towards macroscopic test of local realism. For our purpose we use continuous modular variables, characterized by continuum spectral eigenvalues. These variables can be clearly demonstrated in Multi-slit interfrometric setup. In Sec. We construct the CV Bell operator of CHSH form from modular variables. In Sec. we proceed with identifying the relevant entangled state leading to the violation of the Bell inequality. Finally, in Sec. we propose a possible implementation of the desired entangled states



\section{Violation of Bell Inequality}


\subsection{CHSH Inequality | prior art}

Here the violation of Bell's inequality for the typical spin case,
is stated in a way that is easier to translate to the continuous variable
case. We first state the Bell test in its modern form, known as the
CHSH inequality. 
\begin{lyxlist}{a}
\item [{Suppose:}] There are two observers%
\footnote{that are often chosen to be sufficiently far away that their measurements
don't influence each other%
}, Alice and Bob. There are two particles, which are allowed to interact
initially and are then separated. Alice takes one, Bob takes the other.
Alice can measure one of two properties of her particle, call them
$a_{1},\, a_{2}$. Similarly Bob can measure $b_{1},\, b_{2}$ of
his particle. 
\item [{Notatn:}] $\left\langle a_{i}b_{j}\right\rangle =$Average value
obtained when Alice chooses to measure $a_{i}$ and Bob chooses to
measure $b_{j}$
\item [{Statemnt:}] $\left|\left\langle a_{1}(b_{1}+b_{2})+a_{2}(b_{1}-b_{2})\right\rangle \right|\equiv\left|\left\langle C(a_{i},b_{i})\right\rangle \right|\le2$
if (a) result of measuring $a_{i},\, b_{i}$ $\in\,[-1,1]$, (b) local
realism is assumed. This result will be referred to as the CHSH inequality. 
\end{lyxlist}
Quantum Mechanics predicts a violation of this in the following physical
situation.
\begin{lyxlist}{a}
\item [{Defn:}] $\left|\psi\right\rangle \equiv\frac{\left|+-\right\rangle -\left|-+\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}$
where the $\left|\pm\right\rangle $ states are s.t. $\hat{\sigma}_{x}\left|\pm\right\rangle =\pm\left|\pm\right\rangle $. 
\item [{Consider:}] (a) Two particles are described by $\left|\psi\right\rangle $
and (b) Alice measures $\hat{z}$ or $\hat{x}$ while Bob is allowed
to choose between $\hat{z}'$ and $\hat{x}'$, where $\hat{z}'=\frac{-\hat{z}-\hat{x}}{\sqrt{2}}$,
$\hat{x}'=\frac{\hat{z}-\hat{x}}{\sqrt{2}}$.
\item [{Notatn:}] The Pauli matrices are referred to as $\hat{x},\,\hat{y},\,\hat{z}$.
\item [{Result:}] $\left\langle C((\hat{x},\hat{z}),(\hat{x}',\hat{z}'))\right\rangle =2\sqrt{2}\nleq2$,
which is a violation. 
\end{lyxlist}
This value can be reproduced in a slightly modified situation.
\begin{lyxlist}{a}
\item [{Modifictn:}] (i) Due to the symmetry in the setup, we expect the
same results hold for $\hat{x},\,\hat{y}$ and $\hat{x}',\,\hat{y}'$
and (ii) we demand that Alice and Bob can only measure $\hat{x}$
but are allowed to perform a local unitary before the measurement.%
\footnote{Note that (ii) is equivalent to measuring along any direction. Details
in the Apendix.%
}
\item [{Explicitly}] then, consider: (a) Alice and Bob apply local unitaries
$e^{i\hat{z}\theta/2}\otimes I$ and $I\otimes e^{i\hat{z}\phi/2}$
respectively and then both measure $\hat{x}$. (b) Alice can choose
$\theta\in\{0,\pi/2\}$ and Bob can choose $\phi\in\{\pi/4,\pi/4+\pi/2\}$;
see table \ref{mesSch1}.%
\footnote{These values are motivated by the $\pi/2$ between $z$ and $x$,
\& $\pi/4$ between $z$ and $z'$ in the conventional Bell case.%
}
\end{lyxlist}
\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c|c}
\multicolumn{1}{l}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Alice} &  & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Bob} & \tabularnewline
\hline 
Convention & $a_{1}$ & $a_{2}$ & $b_{1}$ & $b_{2}$\tabularnewline
Angle & $\theta_{1}=\pi/2$ & $\theta_{2}=0$ & $\phi_{1}=\pi/4$ & $\phi_{2}=\pi/4+\pi/2$\tabularnewline
\end{tabular}

\caption{Measurement Scheme \label{mesSch1}}
\end{table}


Now it remains to show that this scheme also violates the Bell inequality
(and by the same value). To that end, we state a result (see \subref{c3}). 

\[
\left\langle e^{-i\hat{z}\theta/2}\hat{x}e^{i\hat{z}\theta/2}\otimes e^{-i\hat{z}\phi/2}\hat{x}e^{i\hat{z}\phi/2}\right\rangle =-\cos(\phi-\theta)
\]


Given that, it is straight forward to evaluate

\begin{eqnarray*}
\left\langle C\right\rangle  & = & \left\langle a_{1}b_{1}\right\rangle +\left\langle a_{1}b_{2}\right\rangle +\left\langle a_{2}b_{1}\right\rangle -\left\langle a_{2}b_{2}\right\rangle \\
 & = & \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)+\left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)+\left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)-\left(+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\\
 & = & -2\sqrt{2}
\end{eqnarray*}


This is still a violation since $\left|\left\langle C\right\rangle \right|=2\sqrt{2}\nleq2$.
However, to convert this to a more conventional form, we simply redefine
the angles $\theta$ and $\phi$.%
\footnote{so that $\phi-\theta\to\phi'-\theta'=\phi-\theta+\pi=\left(\phi+\pi/2\right)-\left(\theta-\pi/2\right)$%
} 
\begin{lyxlist}{a}
\item [{Substn:}] $\phi\to\phi'=\phi+\pi/2,\,\theta\to\theta'=\theta-\pi/2$;
see table \ref{mesSch2}
\end{lyxlist}
\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Alice} &  & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Bob} & \tabularnewline
\hline 
Convention & $a_{1}$ & $a_{2}$ & $b_{1}$ & $b_{2}$\tabularnewline
Angle & $\theta'_{1}=0$ & $\theta'_{2}=-\pi/2$ & $\phi'_{1}=3\pi/8$ & $\phi'_{2}=5\pi/4$\tabularnewline
\end{tabular}

\caption{`Corrected' Measurement Scheme \label{mesSch2}}
\end{table}
Now we have $\left\langle C\right\rangle =2\sqrt{2}$.

In conclusion, we have shown that, in the spin setting, the violation
of the Bell inequality can be equivalently obtained by the measurement
of $\hat{x}$ after applying a rotation along $\hat{z}$ by the aforesaid
angles.


\subsection{Modular Variables and Displacement Operators | prior art}

The observables admissible in the CHSH inequality must $\in[-1,1]$.
If we consider the \emph{real} \emph{variable} $p\in(-\infty,\infty)$,
then one way of obtaining a bound variable is to use $p_{\text{mod}}\equiv p\mod h/L$,
where $h/L$ has been introduced for dimensional reasons. This forces
$p_{\text{mod}}\in[0,h/L)$. If we further consider, say $\cos(p_{\text{mod}}L/\hbar)$,
then we get precisely the bound needed for the CHSH inequality. We
chose the constant factors so that for $p_{\text{mod}}=h/L$, the
$\cos$ function also completes a period. Note that $\cos(p_{\text{mod}}L/\hbar)=\cos(pL/\hbar)=\frac{e^{ipL/\hbar}+e^{-ipL/\hbar}}{2}$.

Next, recall that in quantum mechanics, the momentum that's quantized,
is one that generates infinitesimal translations. Formally, this means
that $\left(1-i\hat{p}\delta L/\hbar\right)\left|x\right\rangle =\left|x+\delta L\right\rangle $.
If we want a finite translation, we can do the following procedure:
$\lim_{N\to\infty}\left(1-i\frac{\hat{p}}{\hbar}\frac{L}{N}\right)^{N}\left|x\right\rangle =e^{-i\hat{p}L/\hbar}\left|x\right\rangle =\left|x+L\right\rangle $.
This operator is aptly called the displacement operator. We must add
that $e^{i\hat{p}a}e^{i\hat{x}b}=e^{i\hbar ab}e^{i\hat{x}b}e^{i\hat{p}a}$.
Thus for appropriate choices of $a,b$, the displacement operators
can be made to commute or anti-commute. In the former case, it means
one can simultaneously measure modular position and momentum (which
is striking) and in the latter case, one can define pauli matrix like
commutation.

The idea was that the obvious generalization for obtaining an appropriate
operator for the CHSH inequality is $\cos(\hat{p}L/\hbar)=\frac{e^{i\hat{p}L/\hbar}+e^{-i\hat{p}L/\hbar}}{2}$.
While by construction this is bounded, the action of displacement
operators will guide us in creating the appropriate states in the
next sub section.


\subsection{Violation in Continuous Variable State}

We start with constructing continuous variable kets%
\footnote{We emphasise that the kets we construct, will not be a countable superposition
of eigenstates of $p$ or $x$ since these are highly idealized and
strictly, not even a part of the Hilbert space.%
} that satisfy the same orthogonality and mutual relations as $\left|0\right\rangle ,\left|1\right\rangle ,\left|+\right\rangle ,\left|-\right\rangle $.%
\footnote{Defn: $\left|0\right\rangle ,\,\left|1\right\rangle $ are s.t. $\hat{z}\left|0\right\rangle =\left|0\right\rangle $
and $\hat{z}\left|1\right\rangle =-\left|1\right\rangle $%
} We then construct the relevant operators and finally evaluate $\left\langle C\right\rangle $
to show the violation.

To construct the states, we start with some definitions.
\begin{lyxlist}{a}
\item [{Forgt:}] $\hat{x},\,\hat{y},\,\hat{z}$ represent Pauli matrices
\item [{Defn:}] $L\equiv$some length scale, $N\equiv$number of slits
\end{lyxlist}
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[bb=0bp 90bp 359bp 222bp,clip,width=6cm]{plots/zeroOne}\\

states for $N=8,\, L=1$ unit. The $\left|\psi{}_{0}\right\rangle ,\,\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle $
states are not normalized.\label{fig:wavefns}}
\end{figure}

\begin{lyxlist}{a}
\item [{Consider:}] A state $\left|\varphi\right\rangle $ symmetric about
$x=L/2$, with spread $\ll L$. Formally, $\left|\varphi\right\rangle \equiv\int dx\left\langle x-L/2|\varphi'\right\rangle \left|x\right\rangle $
where $\left|\varphi'\right\rangle $ s.t. (a) $\left\langle x|\varphi'\right\rangle =\left\langle -x|\varphi'\right\rangle $
and (b) it's spread is $\ll L$
\item [{Defn:}] $\left|\varphi_{n}\right\rangle \equiv\int dx\left\langle x-nL|\varphi\right\rangle \left|x\right\rangle $ 
\item [{Defn:}] $I_{N}=\{-\frac{N}{2},\dots,\frac{N}{2}-1,\frac{N}{2}-1\}$,
defined for even $N$ only (for simplicity)
\item [{Defn:}] 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle  & \equiv & \frac{1}{\sqrt{N'}}\sum_{n\in I_{N'}}\left|\varphi_{2n+1}\right\rangle \\
\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle  & \equiv & \frac{1}{\sqrt{N'}}\sum_{n\in I_{N'}}\left|\varphi_{2n}\right\rangle 
\end{eqnarray*}
where $N'\equiv N/2$
\end{lyxlist}
Using these states, as illustrated in \figref{wavefns}, we construct
the analogues of the $\left|\psi_{+}\right\rangle $ and $\left|\psi_{-}\right\rangle $
states.
\begin{lyxlist}{a}
\item [{Remark:}] Definition of $\left|\psi_{\pm}\right\rangle $ justify
the word `slit' in the definition of $N$. 
\item [{Defn:}] $\left|\psi_{+}\right\rangle \equiv\frac{\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle +\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}},\,\left|\psi_{-}\right\rangle \equiv\frac{\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle -\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}$
\item [{NB:}] $\left\langle \psi_{0}|\psi_{1}\right\rangle =0,\,\implies\left\langle \psi_{+}|\psi_{-}\right\rangle =0$
\end{lyxlist}
Analogous to the spin case, we construct the entangled state 
\begin{lyxlist}{a}
\item [{Defn:}] $\left|\Psi\right\rangle \equiv\frac{\left|\psi_{+}\psi_{-}\right\rangle -\left|\psi_{-}\psi_{+}\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}$
\end{lyxlist}
These states were constructed with a partial translational symmetry
which is appropriate to the hermitian operator, $\cos(\hat{p}L/\hbar)$
discussed earlier.
\begin{lyxlist}{a}
\item [{Defn:}] 
\[
\hat{X}\equiv\frac{e^{i\hat{p}L/\hbar}+e^{-i\hat{p}L/\hbar}}{2}
\]

\item [{NB:}] Only in the limit $N\to\infty$, 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{X}\left|\psi_{+}\right\rangle  & = & +\left|\psi_{+}\right\rangle \\
\hat{X}\left|\psi_{-}\right\rangle  & = & -\left|\psi_{-}\right\rangle 
\end{eqnarray*}
just as was with $\hat{\sigma}_{x}$. In general however, the relation
doesn't hold.
\end{lyxlist}
We have almost all the cards, except for one that allows for setting
\{$\phi$, $\theta$\}. In the spin case, this was achieved by operating
$e^{i\hat{\sigma}_{z}\phi/2}$ on the state before measurement. Correspondingly,
here we define this operator by it's action on the relevant state. 
\begin{lyxlist}{a}
\item [{Defn:}] $\hat{U}(\phi)$ is defined to be s.t. 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{U}(\phi)\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle  & = & e^{i\phi/2}\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle \\
\hat{U}(\phi)\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle  & = & e^{-i\phi/2}\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle 
\end{eqnarray*}

\end{lyxlist}
This can achieved in principle using alternate glass slabs for photons,
to adjust the relative phase as desired, since $\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle $
and $\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle $ are spatially separated. Alternatively,
we could also define $\hat{U}(\phi)$ in its analytic form. First
we claim that $\exists$ an operator $\hat{Z}$ s.t. it satisfies
$\hat{Z}\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle =\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle $
and $\hat{Z}\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle =-\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle $.
Before explicitly defining $\hat{Z}$, we observe that given this
operator, we can naturally define the analytic form of $\hat{U}(\phi)$.

Alt~Defn: 
\[
\hat{U}(\phi)=e^{i\hat{Z}\phi/2}
\]
in close analogy with the spin case. It is suggestive from this form
that $\hat{Z}$ must play the role of $\hat{\sigma}_{z}$. We know
that $\hat{X}$ is a function of $\hat{p}_{\text{mod}}$. It is thus
natural to expect $\hat{Z}$ to be a function of $\hat{x}_{\text{mod}}$.
From it's action, we also note that $\hat{Z}$ must differentiate
between spatial wavefunctions $\left\langle x|\varphi\right\rangle $
and $\left\langle x-L|\varphi\right\rangle $. Thus the appropriate
operator must be $\hat{x}_{\text{mod}2L}$ and not $\hat{x}_{\text{mod}L}$.
This is supported by the fact that $[\hat{p}_{\text{mod}},\hat{x}_{\text{mod}L}]=0$.
Now since the action of $\hat{Z}$ must work for arbitrary $\left|\varphi\right\rangle $
and $N$, we define 
\[
\hat{Z}\equiv Z(\hat{x}_{\text{mod}2L})
\]
where $Z$ is some appropriate function, so that $\hat{Z}\left|x\right\rangle =Z(\hat{x}_{\text{mod}2L})\left|x\right\rangle =Z(x_{\text{mod}2L})\left|x\right\rangle $
. From the constraints on $\hat{Z}$, we conclude that for consistency,
we must define%
\footnote{$\hat{x}_{\text{mod}2L}$ is well defined, see \subref{c6}%
} 
\[
Z(x)\equiv\begin{cases}
1 & 0<x\le L\\
-1 & L<x\le2L
\end{cases}
\]


\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{plots/CHSH}\caption{Practically, the number of slits, $N$ will be finite. The plot shows
$\left\langle C\right\rangle $ as a function of $N$. To get a violation,
we need merely $7$ slits, while with $50$ we are almost at $2\sqrt{2}$.\label{chshViolation}}
\end{figure}


To evaluate the CHSH inequality, we again need terms of the form $\left\langle \hat{U}^{\dagger}(\phi_{i})\hat{X}\hat{U}(\phi_{i})\otimes\hat{U}^{\dagger}(\theta_{i})\hat{X}\hat{U}(\theta_{i})\right\rangle $.
If we assume $N\to\infty$, these can be evaluated easily to be the
same as before $-\cos(\phi_{i}-\theta_{i})$. Thus, the same analysis
as before yields $\left\langle C\right\rangle =2\sqrt{2}$ which is
the same maximal violation, in a completely different setup. If $N$
is not assumed to be arbitrarily large, then it can be shown that
(see \subref{c5})

\begin{eqnarray*}
\left\langle \hat{U}^{\dagger}(\phi_{i})\hat{X}\hat{U}(\phi_{i})\otimes\hat{U}^{\dagger}(\theta_{i})\hat{X}\hat{U}(\theta_{i})\right\rangle  & =\\
 & -\left(\frac{N-1}{N}\right)^{2} & \cos(\phi_{i}-\theta_{i})
\end{eqnarray*}


Thus obviously then, $\left\langle C\right\rangle =\left(\frac{N-1}{N}\right)^{2}2\sqrt{2}$.
If we ask for the smallest $N$ s.t. $\left\langle C\right\rangle >2$,
we get $N\ge7$; see figure \ref{chshViolation}.


\subsection{Validating phase space behaviour}

In the past, it has been shown that one can arrive at the violation
of the Bell inequality in continuous variable systems. One issue concerning
some of these approaches is that the wavefunction used is highly idealized
and not normalizable, such as $\left|p\right\rangle $ and $\left|q\right\rangle $
or their countable superposition. Another issue in certain other approaches,
is that the wigner functions corresponding to the observables, are
unbounded. An example of this is parity. Note that while the Wigner
function for a physical state $\rho$ has an upper bound, here we
are simply using the prescription to evaluate the same for hermitian
operators.

We care because wigner functions maybe thought of as a specific case
of the Wigner-Weyl correspondence, which is a one-one map between
classical functions and their corresponding quantum operators. Thus,
in a phase-space description of quantum mechanics, it is important
to show that it is not necessary to have unboundedness in observables
to arrive a violation of the Bell's inequality, and thereby non-locality. 

In our case, $\left|\Psi\right\rangle $ is manifestly normalized.
We must show that the observable in our case, given by $\hat{U}^{\dagger}(\phi)\hat{X}\hat{U}(\phi)$
is also bounded. To that end, we note that

%\begin{widetext}

%\end{widetext}

\begin{eqnarray*}
W_{1}(q,p) & = & \frac{1}{2\pi\hbar}\int dq'e^{ipq'/\hbar}\left\langle q-\frac{q'}{2}\right|e^{-iZ(\hat{x}_{mod2L})\phi/2}\\
 &  & e^{i\hat{p}\frac{L}{\hbar}}e^{iZ(\hat{x}_{mod2L})\phi/2}\left|q+\frac{q'}{2}\right\rangle \\
 & = & \frac{1}{2\pi\hbar}e^{-iZ_{1}(q)\phi/2}e^{ip\frac{L}{\hbar}}e^{iZ_{2}(q)\phi/2}\\
 & = & \frac{1}{2\pi\hbar}e^{ipL/\hbar}e^{iZ_{2}(q)\phi}
\end{eqnarray*}
where $Z_{1/2}(q)=Z[(q\mp\frac{L}{2})\text{mod}2L]$ and we used the
fact that $Z(x)=-Z(x+L)$ (omitting the $\text{mod}2L$). Similarly
one can evaluate $W_{2}$ and obtain 
\[
W=\left(W_{1}+W_{2}\right)/2=\frac{1}{2\pi\hbar}\cos(pL/\hbar)e^{\pm i\phi}
\]
 which corresponds to the observable (we used that $Z_{2}=\pm1$).
Clearly $\left|W\right|\le\left(2\pi\hbar\right)^{-1}$.


\subsection{Source of Violation}

In the Bell test done with spins, the source of violation hinges on
the non-commutativity of the Pauli matrices. It is known that $C^{2}=4\mathbb{I}+[a_{1},a_{2}]\otimes[b_{1},b_{2}]$,
when $a_{i},b_{i}\in\{-1,1\}$. To obtain a violation in general (where
the first term maybe less than $4\mathbb{I}$), it is therefore necessary
that the commutations don't vanish. This is indeed true in our case.
Explicitly, we must have $[\hat{U}^{\dagger}\hat{X}\hat{U},\hat{U}'^{\dagger}\hat{X}\hat{U}']\neq0$.
To arrive at the desired expression we first evaluate some simpler
commutation and anti-commutation relations explicitly. Let's start
with $[\hat{Z},e^{i\hat{p}L/\hbar}]=\hat{Z}e^{i\hat{p}L/\hbar}-e^{i\hat{p}L/\hbar}\hat{Z}$.
To evaluate it, we multiply the second term with $\int dx\left|x\right\rangle \left\langle x\right|$
and obtain $Ze^{i\hat{p}L/\hbar}+Ze^{i\hat{p}L/\hbar}$ where we've
used $Z(\hat{x}_{\text{mod}2L})=-Z(\left(\hat{x}\pm L\right)_{\text{mod}2L})$
and $e^{i\hat{p}L/\hbar}\left|x\right\rangle =\left|x-L\right\rangle $.
Thus we have 
\[
[\hat{Z},\hat{X}]=2\hat{Z}\hat{X}=-2i\hat{Y}
\]
where $\hat{Y}=i\hat{Z}\hat{X}$. Here $i$ was introduced to ensure
$\hat{Y}^{\dagger}=\hat{Y}$, since $\hat{X}^{\dagger}=\hat{X}$ and
$\hat{Z}^{\dagger}=\hat{Z}$. Similarly it follows that $\{\hat{Z},\hat{X}\}=0$.
From the definition of $Y$ and the anti-commutation, $\{\hat{Y},\hat{X}\}=0$
and $\{\hat{Y},\hat{Z}\}=0$ also follow trivially. While we're at
it, we may state that while $\hat{Z}^{2}=1$, it is not a sum of a
2 state projector and $\hat{X}^{2}\neq1$ in general. This manifests
in the other commutation relations 
\begin{eqnarray*}
[\hat{X},\hat{Y}] & = & -2i\hat{Z}\hat{X}^{2}=-2i\hat{X}^{2}\hat{Z}\\{}
[\hat{Y},\hat{Z}] & = & -2i\hat{X}
\end{eqnarray*}


Further, note that $e^{-i\hat{Z}\phi/2}\hat{X}e^{i\hat{Z}\phi/2}=\hat{X}e^{i\hat{Z}\phi}$
and that $e^{i\hat{Z}\phi}=\cos\phi+i\hat{Z}\sin\phi$. With all these,
it is easy to show that 
\begin{eqnarray*}
[\hat{U}^{\dagger}(\frac{\phi}{2})\hat{X}\hat{U}(\frac{\phi}{2}),\hat{U}^{\dagger}(\frac{\phi'}{2})\hat{X}\hat{U}(\frac{\phi'}{2})] & =\\
\left(\cos\phi\sin\phi'-\sin\phi\cos\phi'\right)\hat{Z}\hat{X}^{2} & \neq & 0
\end{eqnarray*}
as was necessary. Ofcourse this is not sufficient, however we have
shown explicitly the violation. This evaluation was meant to illuminate
that the source of violation essentially hinges on $[\hat{x}_{\text{mod}2L},\hat{p}_{\text{mod}}]\neq0$.
It is apparent that the complete pauli algebra is unnecessary for
showing a violation. 


\subsection{Advantage of asymmetry in $\hat{X}$ and $\hat{Z}$}

Considering the operator (non-hermitian for simplicity) $\hat{X}=e^{i\hat{p}L/\hbar}$,
defining $\hat{Z}=e^{i\hat{x}2\pi/2L}$ is more natural. They also
follow the desired anti-commutation $\{\hat{X},\hat{Z}\}=0$ and we
could define $\hat{Y}=\hat{iZ}\hat{X}$ to get a more natural generalization.
The question is why did $\hat{Z}=Z(\hat{x}_{\text{mod}2L})$ appear
in the analysis. The cause of this asymmetry hinges on the preferential
treatment of position space. We could have constructed states of the
form $\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle =\sum_{n}\left|x+nd\right\rangle $
and used the natural definition of $\hat{Z}$ to obtain the violation.
The issue is that this forces us to choose a countable superposition
of position eigenkets as our desired state. Such a state is strictly
not even in the Hilbert space. In the scheme proposed, this issue
is resolved by $Z(\hat{x}_{\text{mod}2L})$ which causes a larger
set of physically realizable states to become admissible.

Thus while our construction is motivated by the spin formalism, it
is not just a relabelling of states and operators achieved by a severe
restriction of the Hilbert space. 


\section{Physical Implementation}

We show that this scheme can be implemented rather easily using photons.
We harness the two degrees of freedom of a photon, it's polarization
and it's position to construct the required state. With a slightly
modified setup, it is possible to do the same with spin and position
for matter waves (see \subref{c7}). The overall setup (see \figref{scheme})
is such that we need only consider the quantum mechanical description
along the $x$-axis.


\subsection{Creation of the entangled state}

The desired entangled state is $\left|\Psi\right\rangle \equiv\frac{\left|\psi_{+}\psi_{-}\right\rangle -\left|\psi_{-}\psi_{+}\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}$.
We start with noting the triviality of constructing a 
\[
\left|\psi_{+}\right\rangle =\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{n\in I_{N}}\left|\varphi_{n}\right\rangle 
\]
 state. One simply needs a source and a grating, viz. a screen with
$N$ slits of width $a\ll L$, separated by a distance $L$ (centre
to centre). The 
\[
\left|\psi_{-}\right\rangle =\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{n\in I_{N}}\left(-1\right)^{n+1}\left|\varphi_{n}\right\rangle 
\]
 state can be similarly constructed by using glass slabs at alternate
slits, such that the phase introduced is $\phi=\pi\,\implies\, e^{i\phi}=-1$.
In \figref{scheme}, if you consider only one particle, and disregard
everything after the grating, then the setup is expected to produce
a $\left|\psi_{+}\right\rangle $ state, just after the grating. To
produce the desired entangled state, we start with two entangled photons,
such that their polarization state can be expressed as $\left|\chi\right\rangle =\frac{\left|HV\right\rangle -\left|VH\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}$.
Their spatial description (along $x$-axis) is initially assumed to
be $\left|\zeta\right\rangle =\left|\gamma\right\rangle \otimes\left|\gamma\right\rangle =\left|\gamma\gamma\right\rangle $.
Thus the initial state is 
\[
\left|\chi\right\rangle \left|\zeta\right\rangle =\frac{\left|HV\right\rangle -\left|VH\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}\left|\gamma\gamma\right\rangle 
\]


The state $\left|\gamma\right\rangle $ maybe considered to be a Gaussian
with $\sigma\gg2NL$ so that after the grating, the spatial state
can be written as 
\[
\left|\chi\right\rangle \left|\zeta_{\text{grating}}\right\rangle =\frac{\left|HV\right\rangle -\left|VH\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}\left|\psi_{+}\psi_{+}\right\rangle 
\]
Now comes the interesting part. To produce a $\left|\psi_{-}\right\rangle $
state, we already know we needed alternate glass slabs. If we had
glass slabs, whose refractive index (given some orientation) was say
$\eta_{H}=1$ for a horizontally polarized beam and $\eta_{V}=\eta\neq1$
for vertical polarization, then we could harness the entangled polarization
state to create the required spatially entangled state. Birefringent
crystals have such polarization dependent refractive indices. Assume
that alternating birefringent crystals have been placed after both
the gratings as shown in \figref{scheme} (in the diagram, they're
not alternating though as will be explained shortly). These have width
such that the resultant phase it introduces is $\pi$ and the state
is 
\[
\left|\chi\right\rangle \left|\zeta_{\text{birefringent}}\right\rangle =\frac{\left|HV\right\rangle \left|\psi_{+}\psi_{-}\right\rangle -\left|VH\right\rangle \left|\psi_{-}\psi_{+}\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}
\]
At this stage, if we were to trace out the polarization state, we'd
end up with a mixed state. That is useless for our test. Ignoring
the glass slabs at the moment in \figref{scheme}, we observe the
action of the polarisers on the state. After the $45^{\circ}$ polariser,
the state becomes (see \subref{c8}) 
\[
\left|\chi_{\text{45}}\right\rangle \left|\zeta_{\text{birefringent}}\right\rangle \propto\left|H'H'\right\rangle \left(\frac{\left|\psi_{+}\psi_{-}\right\rangle -\left|\psi_{-}\psi_{+}\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}\right)
\]
where $\left|H'\right\rangle \equiv\left(\left|H\right\rangle +\left|V\right\rangle \right)/\sqrt{2}$.
Now if we trace out the polarization state, we'd be left with the
target entangled state. As a remark, it maybe be stated that although
to arrive at this result we assumed that $\eta_{H}=1$, which is unreasonable
physically, we can compensate for $\eta_{H}\neq1$ by putting appropriate
glass slabs at the alternate empty slits, to produce zero relative
phase when the polarization is horizontal.

\end{figure*}



\subsection{Measurement Settings}

In our scheme, Alice and Bob can choose $\phi\in\{\phi_{1},\phi_{2}\}$
and $\theta\in\{\theta_{1},\theta_{2}\}$ respectively. To implement
this, we note that the action of $\hat{U}(\theta)$ is to introduce
a phase difference between the $\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle $ and
$\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle $ states. By construction, $\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle $
and $\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle $ are spatially disjoint; thus the
operation of $\hat{U}(\theta)$ can be implemented by simply placing
alternating glass slabs at the slits, with widths such that $\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle \to e^{i\theta/2}\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle $
and $\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle \to e^{-i\theta/2}\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle $.
The same operation maybe done for $\hat{U}(\phi)$ for the second
particle. In the overall scheme, as shown in \figref{scheme}, this
is done by the glass slabs right after the birefringent crystals.
The state after application of the unitaries is given by $\left|\Psi_{f}\right\rangle $,
where $f$ is used to index which of the four possible measurement
settings was used. 


\subsection{Measurement}

The scheme requires us to evaluate the expectation value of $\hat{X}\otimes\hat{X}$
(after the measurement settings have been applied by the appropriate
unitaries). If from the experiment, we can obtain the probability
$\left|\left\langle p{}_{A},p{}_{B}|\Psi_{f}\right\rangle \right|^{2}$,
then evaluating $\left\langle \hat{X}\otimes\hat{X}\right\rangle =\left\langle \cos(\hat{p}L/\hbar)\otimes\cos(\hat{p}L/\hbar)\right\rangle $
simply amounts to $\int dp{}_{A}dp{}_{B}\cos(p{}_{A}L/\hbar)\cos(p{}_{B}L/\hbar)\left|\left\langle p{}_{A},p{}_{B}|\Psi_{f}\right\rangle \right|^{2}$. 

Therefore it is sufficient to explain how to obtain the joint momentum
probability distribution from the experiment, for a given measurement
setting. We start with stating the result that in the far-field approximation,
\[
\left|\left\langle x{}_{A},x{}_{B}|\Psi{}_{f\,\text{screen}}\right\rangle \right|^{2}\propto\left|\left\langle p{}_{A}=\frac{p_{z}x{}_{A}}{D},p{}_{B}=\frac{p_{z}x{}_{B}}{D}|\Psi_{f}\right\rangle \right|^{2}
\]
 where $\left|\Psi{}_{f\,\text{screen}}\right\rangle $ is the state
of the system at the screen, $D$ is the distance between the gratings
and the screens and $p_{z}$ is the $z$ component of momentum of
the particle. For a photon, $p_{z}=h/\lambda$ while for an electron,
$p_{z}=m_{e}D/T$, where $T$ is the time taken to arrive at the screen
from the grating. The idea is simply that the momentum distribution
at the grating can be recovered by observing the spatial distribution
at a screen, sufficiently far away.

In an experiment then, there are two possibilities. \\
(a) Given $f$, Alice and Bob both note the position at which they
obtain their particle. After repeating the experiment sufficiently
many times, they share their list to create a sequence $\{\left(x{}_{A}^{(i)},x_{B}^{(i)}\right)\}$.
From this sequence, they create a 2D histogram, by simply counting
how many time they got $(x'_{A},x'_{B})$ to lie inside a given cell.
The normalized result is essentially $\left|\left\langle x{}_{A},x{}_{B}|\Psi{}_{f\,\text{screen}}\right\rangle \right|^{2}$
from which $\left\langle \hat{X}\otimes\hat{X}\right\rangle $ can
be computed as discussed. $f$ is changed to evaluate all the 4 terms
to finally obtain $\left\langle C\right\rangle $ experimentally.
\\
(b) The other simpler, equivalent and direct possibility is that Alice
and Bob both obtain the position, $\{x_{A}^{(i)},x_{B}^{(i)}\}$ for
the $i$th repetition and evaluate $\cos(p_{A}^{(i)}L/\hbar)$ and
$\cos(p_{B}^{(i)}L/\hbar)$. After sufficient iterations (for all
values of $f$), they exchange their observations to simply evaluate
the average, viz. 
\[
\frac{\sum_{i}\cos(p_{A}^{(i)}L/\hbar)\cos(p_{B}^{(i)}L/\hbar)}{\sum_{i}}=\left\langle C\right\rangle 
\]



\section{Conclusion}

We have shown how to realize a Bell test in continuous variables position
and momentum using specifically chosen and physically realizable states.
In addition it has been demonstrated that the exact pauli commutation
relations aren't necessary to capture the essence of non-locality;
infact by relaxing the similarity, the set of states that show a violation
is made considerably larger.


\section{Appendix}


\subsubsection*{Illustration (I)}

This is trival if one uses the Bloch sphere picture. Instead of measuring
along an arbitrary axis, we rotate the Bloch sphere appropriately,
and then measure $x$. To illustrate this, consider
\begin{lyxlist}{a}
\item [{Questn:}] $\exists\,\text{a}\,\hat{U},\, s.t.\,\text{if}\,\left|\chi\right\rangle \to\left|\chi'\right\rangle =\hat{U}\left|\chi\right\rangle \,\mbox{\text{then}\,}\left\langle \chi\left|\hat{x}\right|\chi\right\rangle =\left\langle \chi'\left|\hat{y}\right|\chi'\right\rangle $?
\\
Explicitly, we have 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat{y} & = & \hat{U}^{\dagger}\hat{x}\hat{U}=e^{-i\hat{z}\theta/2}\hat{x}e^{i\hat{z}\theta/2}\\
 & = & \hat{x}e^{i\hat{z}\theta}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 & 1\\
1 & 0
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{cc}
e^{i\theta} & 0\\
0 & e^{-i\theta}
\end{array}\right]\\
 & = & \left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 & -i\\
i & 0
\end{array}\right]
\end{eqnarray*}
for $\theta=\pi/2$ as one would guess geometrically.

\end{eqnarray*}
We define, $\delta\equiv\phi-\theta$ and using \subref{c1}, it follows
that only terms like $\left|+-\right\rangle $ or $\left|-+\right\rangle $;
so
\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{LHS} & = & \left\langle \psi\right|x\otimes x\\

Proof: We start with defining $\phi\equiv\phi_{i}$ , $\theta\equiv\theta_{i}$,
$\delta\equiv\phi-\theta$, $\delta'\equiv\delta/2$. Next, we note
that $\text{LHS}=\left\langle \Psi'\left|\hat{X}\otimes\hat{X}\right|\Psi'\right\rangle $
where $\left|\Psi'\right\rangle =\hat{U}(\phi_{i})\otimes\hat{U}(\theta_{i})\left|\Psi\right\rangle $.
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left|\Psi'\right\rangle  & = & \frac{e^{i\delta'}}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\frac{\left|\psi_{+}\right\rangle -\left|\psi_{-}\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}\right)\left(\frac{\left|\psi_{+}\right\rangle +\left|\psi_{-}\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}\right)\\

 & = & -\left(\frac{N-1}{N}\right)^{2}\cos\left(\delta\right)
\end{eqnarray*}



\subsubsection{Action of $\hat{x}_{\text{mod}2L}$ can be defined explicitly\label{sub:c6}}

Proof: $\hat{x}_{\text{mod}2L}\equiv\int dxx{}_{mod2L}\left|x\right\rangle \left\langle x\right|$.
To arrive at this more carefully, consider the operator $e^{i\hat{x}\frac{2\pi}{2L}}$.
Note that $e^{i\hat{x}\frac{2\pi}{2L}}\left|x\right\rangle =e^{ix\frac{2\pi}{2L}}\left|x\right\rangle =e^{ix{}_{mod2L}\frac{2\pi}{2L}}\left|x\right\rangle $.
Thus, $\hat{x}_{\text{mod}2L}\left|x\right\rangle =x{}_{mod2L}\left|x\right\rangle $,
consequently on the most general state $\left|f\right\rangle \equiv\int dxf_{x}\left|x\right\rangle $
then, we'd have $\hat{x}_{\text{mod}2L}\left|f\right\rangle =\int dxf_{x}x{}_{mod2L}\left|x\right\rangle $. 

Remark: One needn't necessarily consider eigenstates of $\hat{x}$
to define the action. Eigenstates of $e^{i\hat{x}\frac{2\pi}{2L}}$
maybe considered instead; they can be expressed as (a) $\left|\varphi\right\rangle ,\, s.t.\,\left\langle p+\frac{h}{2L}|\varphi\right\rangle =\left\langle p|\varphi\right\rangle ,\,\forall\, p\in\mathbb{R}$
or (b) $\left|\bar{x}\right\rangle \propto\sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}\left|\bar{x}+n2L\right\rangle $.
Using the second expression, we have $e^{i\hat{x}\frac{2\pi}{2L}}\left|\bar{x}\right\rangle =e^{i\bar{x}\frac{2\pi}{2L}}\left|\bar{x}\right\rangle $.
Thus on a more general state, $\left|c\right\rangle \equiv\int_{0}^{2L}d\bar{x}c_{\bar{x}}\left|\bar{x}\right\rangle $,
we have $\hat{x}_{\text{mod}2L}\left|c\right\rangle =\int_{0}^{2L}d\bar{x}c_{\bar{x}}\bar{x}\left|\bar{x}\right\rangle $.

\subsubsection{Physical implementation with electrons is also possible\label{sub:c7}}

If we can show that the basic components used to describe the photon
setup can be translated to the electron setup, then in principle we
are through. (a) Glass slab: The equivalent is the electric AB effect.
We need to simply put a capacitor after the slit and the two components
will pick up a phase difference. (b) Polariser: The Stern Gerlach
setup is the classic analogue. We simply block the orthogonal component.
(c) Birefringent crystal: This is slightly tricky. It can be modelled
by using a combination of gradient of magnetic field (as in Stern
Gerlach) and a capacitor. We start with an equivalent superposition
of spin states, $\frac{\left|\uparrow\downarrow\right\rangle -\left|\downarrow\uparrow\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}\left|\psi_{+}\psi_{+}\right\rangle $.
To construct the spin dependent $\left|\psi_{-}\right\rangle $ state,
we use the magnetic field gradient to spatially separate the $\left|\uparrow\right\rangle $
and $\left|\downarrow\right\rangle $ states. We place capacitors
as described at the spatial position corresponding to $\left|\downarrow\right\rangle $
say. Thereafter, we remove the magnetic field gradient and allow the
beams to meet again. This will effectively act as a Birefringent crystal,
since the phase difference is spin dependent.


\subsubsection{Action of a polariser\label{sub:c8}}

If we define $\left|H'\right\rangle \equiv\frac{\left|H\right\rangle +\left|V\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}},$
$\left|V'\right\rangle \equiv-\frac{\left|H\right\rangle -\left|V\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}$
and the $45^{\circ}$ projector as $\left|H'\right\rangle \left\langle H'\right|$,
then both $\left|H\right\rangle \to\left|H'\right\rangle $ and $\left|V\right\rangle \to\left|H'\right\rangle $
where ofcourse with a probability $1/2$, the photon will be lost.
