We propose a local realism test, constructed using correlation measurements of continuum valued functions of positions and momenta, known as modular variables. 
The Wigner representation of these particular observables are bounded in phase space, and therefore, the associated inequality holds for any state described by a non-negative Wigner function. This conforms with Bell's remark that positive Wigner functions, serving as a valid probability distribution over local (hidden) phase space coordinates, do not reveal non-locality. We construct a class of entangled states resulting in the violation of the inequality, and thus truly demonstrate non-locality in phase space. The states can be realized through grating techniques in a space-like separated interferometric setups. The non-locality is verified from the spatial correlation data, collected from the screens.

\section{Introduction}


In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) 
argued using a thought experiment that the quantum-mechanical description of 
physical reality is not complete, and thus may be superseded by a more 
complete realistic theory which reproduces the quantum mechanical predictions, and 
at the same time, obeys the locality condition \cite{EPR}. In his groundbreaking paper in 1964 \cite{Bell}  
Bell derived an experimentally testable inequality, which
bounds the correlations between bipartite measurements
for any such local hidden-variable theory, but which is violated
by quantum mechanics. This was a major breakthrough towards empirical 
tests of quantum mechanics as opposed to common sense theories. Since 
then, the results constraining the permissible types of hidden variable 
models of quantum mechanics have attracted much attention and have been 
reformulated as the problem of contextual measurements by Kochen and 
Specker~\cite{Kochen} and in terms of temporal correlations by Leggett 
and Garg~\cite{LG85}. Today, these concepts have mainly been formulated for intrinsic quantum degrees of freedom of microscopic particles such as spins, and tested in various 
experiments with photons~\cite{Aspect1999}, %ions~\cite{Roos09}, 
impurity spins~\cite{WaldherrPRL2011,KneeNatComm2012} or superconducting 
qubits~\cite{Palacios-LaloyNatPhys2010}. All experimental observations confirmed the validity of quantum non-locality at this level. 
 
%The outstanding challenge is, however, to formulate similar tests with truly phase space measurements and observe the non-locality directly from the observation of spatial degree of freedom. 
The outstanding challenge is, however, to formulate similar tests with truly phase space measurements where non-locality is inferred directly from observing the spatial degree of freedom. %which maybe inferred directly from observation of only the spatial degree of freedom.
This can be viewed as a natural extension to the macroscopic limit of local realism tests \cite{Reid}.  This is closer in spirit to the original EPR argument which uses phase space description to better address the reality and locality problems of quantum mechanics. Indeed, phase space is a natural concept in classical theory and it is equivalent to the state space. % in such manifold. 
Notably, the Wigner function associated with the entangled state used in the EPR argument, the so called EPR state, is non-negative everywhere. Bell argued that EPR states do not lead to a violation of the inequalities derived from locality and hidden variable assumptions. This was because non-negative Wigner functions serve as valid joint probability distributions over local \emph{hidden} positions and momenta. Thereby, in principle, a model of local hidden variable can be attributed to such states. Banaszek and Wodkiewicz \cite{Parity98}, however, showed that using particular measurements, namely parity, EPR states can reveal non-local features indicating that not only the state itself but the type of correlation measurements is also important in any local realism test. This opens the discussion as to which measurements are good candidates for appropriately testing local hidden variable models in phase space \cite{Revzen}. The problem of constructing a ``macroscopic'' test of local hidden variable models hinges on choosing proper observables whose  Wigner representations satisfy the constraint imposed by the algebraic Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) \cite{CHSH69} expression. The term ``macroscopic'' henceforth, will be used to refer to the measurement of a particle's phase space coordinates. This type of measurements are supposed to have a clear description in classical limit and their evaluations do not involve sharp measurements resolving individual eigenstates.

The paper is organized as follows.
In section \ref{framework}, we introduce our framework for the Bell test, aiming to use most ``classical-like'' variables and measurements. This motivates a macroscopic test of local realism \cite{Reid}. The observables we use are the so called modular variables \cite{Ahar69}. Recently, such variables have found applications in detecting certain continuous variable (CV) entangled states ~\cite{Gneiting11, ModularExp} and quantum information \cite{ModularQI}. Furthermore, they have been used for fundamental tests such as macroscopic realism \cite{AsadianLG}, contextuality \cite{Plastino, AsadianPS} and even the GHZ test \cite{Massar01}. This strongly suggests that modular variables can be used for local realism tests as well.  In section \ref{construction} we construct a Bell operator from modular variables, for which the violation is achieved only if the state is described by a negative Wigner function. We then proceed with identification of the relevant entangled state, explicitly showing the violation. % of the Bell inequality. 
Finally, in section \ref{physicalImplementation} we show how the entire test can be implemented in a double grating setup \cite{Gneiting13}. Grating techniques have been used as a powerful experimental demonstration of the quantum matter wave exhibited by massive particles \cite{GratingExp}.




\section{Framework for macroscopic Bell test \label{framework}}

In what follows we develop a new test of local realism which complies with Bell's aforesaid argument. The central problem here is to construct a Bell-operator of the CHSH form
\begin{equation}
\label{Belloperator}
\hat {\mathcal{B}} \equiv \hat A_1\otimes (\hat A_2+\hat A_2') +\hat A_1'\otimes(\hat A_2-\hat A_2')
\end{equation}
expressed in terms of suitable local CV observables $\hat A_i$ which take a limited range of values to impose a well-defined classical bound. %be able to determine a well-defined classical bound. 
%We therefore aim to construct a class of bounded observables of CV systems which have the following properties. 
We therefore require the observables to satisfy the following properties. 

(a) %Using proper rescaling for corresponding quantum eigenvalues of the observable we have 
Eigenvalues of $\hat A_i$, $|a_i|\leq 1$ which for bounded observables can be achieved trivially by rescaling. An example of this is the parity operator which was used in \cite{Parity98}.\\
%This is enough to construct a valid Bell operator with a well-defined classical bound. 
While this condition is enough to obtain a classical bound, we demand an extra constraint which is necessary for probing non-locality in phase space. 

(b) The observable $\hat A$ corresponds to a \emph{bounded} c-number function in phase space obtained from the Wigner-Weyl correspondence ($q\leftrightarrow \hat q$, $p\leftrightarrow \hat p$), viz.
\[
|\mathcal{W}_{\hat A}(q, p)| \equiv \left| \int dq' e^{ipq'}\bra{q-\dfrac{q'}{2}}\hat A \ket{q+\dfrac{q'}{2}}\right| \leq 1
\] 
This entails,
\begin{align*}
|\mathcal{W}_{\hat {\mathcal{B}}}(\bs q,\bs p)|&=|\mathcal{W}_{\hat A_1}(q_1,p_1)[\mathcal{W}_{\hat A_2}(q_2,p_2)+\mathcal{W}_{\hat A_2'}(q_2,p_2)] \\&+\mathcal{W}_{\hat A'_1}(q_1,p_1)[\mathcal{W}_{\hat A_2}(q_2,p_2)-\mathcal{W}_{\hat A_2'}(q_2,p_2)]|\leq 2
\end{align*}
where $\bs q\equiv(q_1,q_2)$ and  $\bs p\equiv(p_1, p_2)$, i.e. the Wigner representation of the Bell operator is bounded by 2.
Accordingly, for any state, including the EPR state, described by valid (non-negative) probability distribution over phase space
\begin{equation}
|\mean{\hat{\mathcal{B}}}|=\left| \int W_{\hat {\rho}}(\bs q,\bs p)\mathcal{W}_{\hat {\mathcal{B}}}(\bs q,\bs p)d\bs q d\bs p \right| \leq 2
\end{equation}
where $W_{\hat{\rho}}$ is the Wigner quasi-probability distribution corresponding to $\hat {\rho}$ given by $
W_{\hat {\rho}} = \mathcal{W}_{\hat {\rho}}/2\pi \hbar$. A violation therefore must necessarily hinge on the negativity of the Wigner function describing the state.

Although formally valid, the Bell inequality expressed in terms of displaced parity operators voids the second condition; their Wigner representations are given by delta functions which are unbounded in phase space. \\  %Such a construction can demonstrate non-locality even in states described non-negative Wigner functions, such as the EPR state \cite{Parity98}. \\ %This already voids the above version of inequality. 
%The added condition ascertains that any state described by non-negative Wigner function, including EPR states, satisfies the stated class of Bell inequalities. Hence, any state  leading to a violation must be characterized by a negative Wigner function deviating from a classical  probability distribution for (hidden) phase space coordinates. 
%That's why,  John Bell remarked that as EPR state described by positive Wigner function is compatible with a local hidden variable model, and thus it does not demonstrate nonlocality. This claim can be justified in the sense of above.
%It would be interesting the framework for the Bell test clearly demonstrates that the source of the violation directly originates from the noncommutativity  of the phase space quadratures in quantum mechanics, $[q,p]=i\hbar$. 
For a macroscopic test, the measurement scheme used for evaluating the correlations should have a classical analog for better understanding the description in the classical limit. The parity operator measurements require resolving the  consecutive eigen values. It has been shown that for sufficiently sharp measurements the system inevitably enters a quantum regime and no classical description is possible \cite{Kofler07}. Thus such measurements remotely resemble ``classical-like'' measurements, if at all.

\subsection*{Phase space translation and modular variables }

One particular class of bounded observables can be constructed from the quantum mechanical space translation operator, $e^{-i\hat p L/\hbar}$. As its name suggests, this operator displaces a particle by a finite distance $L$, which in our case will be the distance between two adjacent slits. This operator is not an observable, therefore we define a symmetric combination   
\begin{align}
  \label{translation}
  \hat X \equiv\dfrac{e^{-i\hat p L/\hbar}+e^{i\hat p L/\hbar}}{2} =\cos(\hat p L/\hbar),
\end{align}
which is explicitly Hermitian and bounded by $\pm 1$. In fact the corresponding real function $\mathcal W_{\hat X}=\cos(pL/\hbar)$ is also manifestly  $\le 1$. Further, when $\hat X$ is operated on $\ket{p}$, then only the modular part of $p$ is relevant to the value of the operator. Thus we may define 
\[
\hat p_{\text{mod}\frac{h}{L}}\equiv(\hat pL/h-\floor{\hat pL/h})\dfrac{h}{L}
\]
and note that measuring $\hat p_{\text{mod}\frac{h}{L}}$ is sufficient for obtaining the value of $\hat X$. Conversely, measuring $\hat X$ only yields $\hat p_{\text{mod}\frac{h}{L}}$, not $\hat p$. 
The idea is to construct a Bell operator (see \eq{Belloperator}) from $\hat X$ in which the different measurement settings are chosen by transforming it using suitable unitary operators.

%The observables admissible in the CHSH inequality must $\in[-1,1]$. If we consider the \emph{real} \emph{variable} $p\in(-\infty,\infty)$, then one way of obtaining a bound variable is to use $p_{\text{mod}}\equiv p\mod h/L$, where $h/L$ has been introduced for dimensional reasons. This forces $p_{\text{mod}}\in[0,h/L)$. If we further consider, say $\cos(p_{\text{mod}}L/\hbar)$, then we get precisely the bound needed for the CHSH inequality. We chose the constant factors so that for $p_{\text{mod}}=h/L$, the $\cos$ function also completes a period. Note that $\cos(p_{\text{mod}}L/\hbar)=\cos(pL/\hbar)=\frac{e^{ipL/\hbar}+e^{-ipL/\hbar}}{2}$.

%Next, recall that in quantum mechanics, the momentum that's quantized, is one that generates infinitesimal translations. Formally, this means that $\left(1-i\hat{p}\delta L/\hbar\right)\left|x\right\rangle=\left|x+\delta L\right\rangle $. If we want a finite translation, we can do the following procedure $\lim_{N\to\infty}\left(1-i\frac{\hat{p}}{\hbar}\frac{L}{N}\right)^{N}\left|x\right\rangle=e^{-i\hat{p}L/\hbar}\left|x\right\rangle=\left|x+L\right\rangle $. This operator is aptly called the displacement operator. We must add that $e^{i\hat{p}a}e^{i\hat{x}b}=e^{i\hbar ab}e^{i\hat{x}b}e^{i\hat{p}a}$.
  
%Thus for appropriate choices of $a,b$, the displacement operators can be made to commute or anti-commute. In the former case, it means one can simultaneously measure modular position and momentum (which is striking) and in the latter case, one can define pauli matrix like commutation.

%The idea was that the obvious generalization for obtaining an appropriate operator for the CHSH inequality is $\cos(\hat{p}L/\hbar)=\frac{e^{i\hat{p}L/\hbar}+e^{-i\hat{p}L/\hbar}}{2}$. While by construction this is bounded, the action of displacement operators will guide us in creating the appropriate states in the next sub section.


\section{The construction \label{construction}}

%Modular variable observables entail that spatial symmetry must be harnessed to construct the appropriate entangled state.
%Also, the analogy with the spin state properties will presumably be beneficial in anticipating the structure of the desired entangled states. %\footnote{Defn: $\left|0\right\rangle ,\,\left|1\right\rangle $ are s.t. $\hat{\sigma}_z\left|0\right\rangle =\left|0\right\rangle $
%and $\hat{\sigma}_z\left|1\right\rangle =-\left|1\right\rangle $; $\ket{\pm}$ are s.t. $\hat \sigma_x \ket{\pm}=\pm\ket{\pm}$, where $\hat{\sigma}_x, \hat{\sigma}_y, \hat{\sigma}_z$ refer to Pauli matrices.%
%} states, $\left|0\right\rangle ,\left|1\right\rangle ,\left|+\right\rangle ,\left|-\right\rangle $,  % in constructing the relevant entangled state to achieve violation of the \emph{modular} Bell inequality for suitable choices of measurement settings.%\footnote{We emphasise that the kets we construct, will not be a countable superposition of eigenstates of $\hat p$ or $\hat q$ since these are highly idealized and strictly, not even a part of the Hilbert space.}. 
 Consider a localized state $\varphi(q) = \braket{q|\varphi}$ symmetric about the position $q=L/2$, where $L\equiv$length scale and $\varphi_n(q)\equiv \varphi(q-nL)$. % and $I_{M} \equiv \{-\floor{\frac{M}{2}},-\floor{\frac{M}{2}}+1,\dots,\floor{\frac{M-1}{2}} \}$ where $M$ is an integer. Now we can 
We define %the following as analogues of $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$;

\begin{equation*}
\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle  \equiv  \frac{1}{\sqrt{M}}\sum_{n=-\floor{\frac{M}{2}}}^{\floor{\frac{M-1}{2}}}\left|\varphi_{2n+1}\right\rangle \  ,  \ 
\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle  \equiv  \frac{1}{\sqrt{M}}\sum_{n=-\floor{\frac{M}{2}}}^{\floor{\frac{M-1}{2}}}\left|\varphi_{2n}\right\rangle.
\end{equation*}

states for $N=8,\, L=1$ unit. The $\left|\psi{}_{0}\right\rangle ,\,\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle $
states are not normalized.\label{fig:wavefns}}
\end{figure}
Using these states, as illustrated in \figref{wavefns}, we construct the states
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:psipm}
\left|\psi_{+}\right\rangle \equiv\frac{\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle +\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}} \ \ , \ \
\left|\psi_{-}\right\rangle \equiv\frac{\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle -\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}.
\end{equation}
These states were constructed with a partial translational symmetry which is appropriate to the bounded hermitian operator $\hat X$ discussed earlier. It follows that 
\begin{align*}
\bra{\psi_+} \hat X \ket{\psi_+} &= \frac{N-1}{N} \\
\bra{\psi_-} \hat X \ket{\psi_-} &= -\frac{N-1}{N}
\end{align*}
where $N \equiv 2M$ is the number of `slits'.
Before proceeding further, we introduce a unitary operator $\hat U$ to implement different measurement settings. %Again, 
Motivated by the spins we define $\hat U$ by its action 
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:U}
\hat{U}(\phi)\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle   =  e^{i\phi/2}\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle \ \ \ , \ \ \
\hat{U}(\phi)\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle   = e^{-i\phi/2}\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle 
\end{align}
More explicitly %this motivates the form
\[
\hat{U}(\phi)\equiv e^{i\hat{Z}\phi/2}
\]
where $\hat{Z}$ is s.t. $\hat{Z}\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle =\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle $ and $\hat{Z}\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle =-\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle $. We note that $\hat{Z}$ must differentiate between spatial wavefunctions $\left\langle q|\varphi\right\rangle $ and $\left\langle q-L|\varphi\right\rangle $. It is thus natural to expect $\hat{Z}$ to be a function of  $\hat{q}_{\text{mod} 2L}$, i.e. 
$\hat{Z}\equiv Z(\hat{q}_{\text{mod}2L})$. For consistency then, we conclude that $Z$ must have the form of a square wave and define %From its action on position eigenstates, $Z(\hat{q}_{\text{mod}2L})\left|q\right\rangle =Z(q_{\text{mod}2L})\left|q\right\rangle $ we conclude that $\hat Z$ should have the form of the square wave function
\[
%Z(\hat q_{{\rm mod} 2L} )\equiv \rm sgn \Big[\sin\dfrac{\pi \hat q}{L}\Big].
\hat Z \equiv \rm sgn \left(\sin\dfrac{\hat q \pi}{L}\right).
\]

\caption{Practically, the number of slits, $N$ will be finite. The plot shows
$\braket{ \mathcal {\hat B} } $ as a function of $N$. To get a violation,
we need merely $8$ slits; with $50$ we almost saturate. \label{chshViolation}}
\end{figure}
The test is performed by considering two particles and their observers, Alice and Bob; they apply the aforesaid local unitaries to define the setting, and then measure $\hat X$. %From above the two different parties, Alice and Bob, can chose their measurement settings performed on their respective particles using local unitaries of above form.
We claim that the appropriate entangled state which will yield a violation, given this scheme, is
\begin{equation}
\label{entangledState}
\ket{\Psi} \equiv\frac{ \ket{\psi_{+}}_1\ket{\psi_{-}}_2 - \ket{\psi_{-}}_1\ket{\psi_{+}}_2 }{\sqrt{2}}.
\end{equation}
%Having defined $\Psi$, $\hat A_i$ and $\hat A'_i$, w
We now evaluate $\mean{\mathcal {\hat B}}$. This essentially requires terms like $ \mean{ \hat X(\phi) \otimes \hat X(\theta)}$, where $\hat X (\theta) \equiv \hat U^{\dagger}(\theta) \hat X \hat U(\theta)$. It can be shown that (see \subref{c5})
\[
\mean{\hat X(\phi) \otimes \hat X(\theta)} = -\left( \frac{N-1}{N} \right)^2 \cos(\phi-\theta).\]
Thus for particular angles, i.e. $\theta',\,\phi,\,\theta$ and $\phi'$ successively separated by $\pi/4$, we get
 \[
\ab{\mean{ \mathcal {\hat B} }} =\left(\frac{N-1}{N}\right)^{2}2\sqrt{2}
\] 
The violation, i.e.,  $\ab{\mean{ \mathcal {\hat B} }} >2$, requires $N > 6$; see \fig{chshViolation}. To interpret this, we must ensure that the assumptions of the framework are satisfied, viz. $\mathcal W_{\hat X(\phi)}\le 1$. To that end, we note that
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathcal W_{\hat X (\phi)}(q,p) & = & \frac{1}{2}\int dq'e^{ipq'/\hbar} \bra{q-\frac{q'}{2}}\bigg( e^{-i\hat Z\phi/2}\\
 &  & e^{i\hat{p}\frac{L}{\hbar}}e^{i\hat Z\phi/2} + \text{h.c.} \bigg) \ket{q+\frac{q'}{2}}\\
 & = & \text{Re}\left( e^{-iZ_{-}(q)\phi/2}e^{ip\frac{L}{\hbar}}e^{iZ_{+}(q)\phi/2}\right) \\
 & = & \cos(pL/\hbar \pm Z_{\pm}(q)\phi) \le 1
\end{eqnarray*}
where $Z_{\pm}(q) \equiv Z[(q\pm\frac{L}{2})\text{mod}2L]$ and we used the fact that $Z(q)=-Z(q+L)$ (omitting the $\text{mod}2L$).




\subsection{Commutation and asymmetry}
%1. Pauli Algebra
%2. Asymmetry in Z and X

1. Pauli-like Commutation: While at first the definition of $\hat Z$ might appear arbitrary, we show that it naturally yields Pauli like algebra. We start with $[\hat{Z},e^{i\hat{p}L/\hbar}]=\hat{Z}e^{i\hat{p}L/\hbar}-e^{i\hat{p}L/\hbar}\hat{Z}$. To evaluate it, we multiply the second term with $\int dq\left|q\right\rangle \left\langle q\right|$ and obtain $\hat Ze^{i\hat{p}L/\hbar}+\hat Ze^{i\hat{p}L/\hbar}$ where we've used $Z(\hat{q}_{\text{mod}2L})=-Z(\left(\hat{q}\pm L\right)_{\text{mod}2L})$ and $e^{i\hat{p}L/\hbar}\left|q\right\rangle =\left|q-L\right\rangle $. Thus we have 
\[
[\hat{Z},\hat{X}]=2\hat{Z}\hat{X}=-2i\hat{Y}
\]
where $\hat{Y} \equiv i\hat{Z}\hat{X}$. Here $i$ was introduced to ensure $\hat{Y}^{\dagger}=\hat{Y}$, since $\hat{X}^{\dagger}=\hat{X}$ and $\hat{Z}^{\dagger}=\hat{Z}$. Similarly  $\{\hat{Z},\hat{X}\}=0$. From the definition of $Y$ and the anti-commutation, $\{\hat{Y},\hat{X}\}=0$ and $\{\hat{Y},\hat{Z}\}=0$ also follow trivially. We may point out that while $\hat{Z}^{2}=1$, it is not a sum of a 2 state projector and $\hat{X}^{2}\neq1$ in general. This manifests in the following relations 
\begin{eqnarray*}
[\hat{X},\hat{Y}] & = & -2i\hat{Z}\hat{X}^{2}=-2i\hat{X}^{2}\hat{Z}\\{}
[\hat{Y},\hat{Z}] & = & -2i\hat{X}
\end{eqnarray*}
It is apparent that the exact SU(2) algebra is not necessary to arrive at a violation.

2. Asymmetry in Z and X: Using an anlogous momentum translation operator, the following can be derived from the definition of $\hat p$% $[q,p]=i\hbar$.
\[
e^{i\hat{p}u}e^{i\hat{q}v}=e^{i\hbar uv}e^{i\hat{q}v}e^{i\hat{p}u}
\]
For appropriate choices of $u,v$, the translation operators can be made to commute or anti-commute. In the former case, it means one can simultaneously measure modular position and momentum (which is in stark contrast with $\hat x$ and $\hat p$ measurements) and in the latter case, one can define pauli matrix like commutation.
Considering the operator (non-hermitian for simplicity) $\hat{X}=e^{i\hat{p}L/\hbar}$, defining $\hat{Z}=e^{i\hat{q}2\pi/2L}$ is more natural. They also follow the desired anti-commutation $\{\hat{X},\hat{Z}\}=0$ and we could define $\hat{Y}=\hat{iZ}\hat{X}$ to get a more natural generalization. The question is why did $\hat{Z}=Z(\hat{q}_{\text{mod}2L})$ appear in the analysis. The cause of this asymmetry hinges on the preferential treatment of position space. We could have constructed states of the form $\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle =\sum_{n}\left|q+nd\right\rangle $ and used the natural definition of $\hat{Z}$ to obtain the violation. The issue is that this forces us to choose a countable superposition of position eigenkets as our desired state.\footnote{Such a state is strictly not even in the Hilbert space.} If we start with better defined and broader class of relevant states, $Z(\hat{q}_{\text{mod}2L})$ appears naturally.


\subsection{Source of non-locality}

It is well recognized and can be shown that there is a tight relation between nonlocality and noncommutativity of operators. This can be shown with
\[
\mean{\hat{\mathcal B}^{2}}\leq 4+\mean{[\hat{A}_1,\hat{ A}'_1]\otimes[\hat{ A}_2,\hat{ A}'_2]}.
\]
The violation therefore occurs for choices of settings whose corresponding observables do not commute. In our construction we can demonstrate that the source of violation can be clearly attributed to the noncommutativity between position and momentum, $[\hat q,\hat p]=i\hbar$. This would be regarded as a further illustration that our approach provides a relevant test in phase space. We show that in our case $[\hat X(\theta),\hat X(\theta')]\neq 0$.
%As an illustration, we show $[\hat X(\phi),\hat X(\phi')]\neq 0$; %In the Bell test done with spins, the source of violation hinges on the non-commutativity of the Pauli matrices. 
%Motivation: $\hat{\mathcal B}^{2}=4\mathbb{I}+[\hat{\mathcal A}_1,\hat{\mathcal A}'_1]\otimes[\hat{\mathcal A}_2,\hat{\mathcal A}'_2]$, when $\hat{\mathcal A}^2_i,\hat{\mathcal A}'^2_i=\mathbb I$. To obtain a violation (even in general, where the first term maybe less than $4\mathbb{I}$), it is therefore necessary that the said commutation doesn't vanish. %This is indeed true in our case. %Explicitly, we must have $[\hat X(\phi),\hat X (\phi')]\neq0$. %To arrive at the desired expression we first evaluate some simpler commutation and anti-commutation relations explicitly. 
To prove that, we use $\hat X(\theta)=\hat{X}e^{i\hat{Z}\theta}$, $e^{i\hat{Z}\theta}=\cos\theta+i\hat{Z}\sin\theta$ and the previous results, to arrive at 
\begin{align*}
[\hat X(\theta),\hat X(\theta')] &=
2i\sin(\theta'-\theta) \hat Z \hat X^2 \\
&=2i \hat Z \hat X^2 \neq 0
\end{align*}
where the last equality holds when the angles are as defined. Classically this term not only vanishes, the different measurement settings also become identical. %, but even the commutations %the there can not be any difference between the two settings
The Heisenberg equation of motion for the displacement operator 
\begin{align*}
\frac{d\hat X}{dt} &=i\hbar^{-1} [\hat Z,\hat X] \\  %\frac{\hat p^2}{2m} + \hat Z,\hat X]
  &=i\hbar^{-1} \Big( Z((\hat q)_{\text{mod}2L})-Z(\hat q_{\text{mod}2L}\pm L) \Big) \hat X \\
  &=i\hbar^{-1} 2 \hat Z \hat X
\end{align*}
where $\hat Z$ is the potential, shows that $\hat X (\theta)$ is essentially $\hat X$ at some later time. However, classically, since the particle experiences no force (constant potential), $X(t)=X(t_0)$. This peculiarity is the same as that of the scalar Aharonov-Bohm effect, which is exploited here for realizing different measurement settings.
%This is already peculiar, because in our scenario the particle experiences constant potential, i.e. no force. That means classically the physical variables do not evolve, $X(t)=X(t_0)$. %While for a quantum particle we consider here this is not the case. Modular variable can depend on the potential difference between spatially\emph{ separated} places \cite{PopescuNatPhys2010}. 
%This is essentially nothing else but the scalar Aharonov-Bohm effect being exploited for realizing different settings in our setup. 
Manifestly then, the non-commutativity of $\hat q$ and $\hat p$ results in $\hat X(t)\neq \hat X(t_0)$ (as it follows a non-local equation of motion \cite{PopescuNatPhys2010}) which is pivotal for the violation.
%Ofcourse this is not sufficient, however we have shown explicitly the violation. We remark that (a) the entire structure hinges on $[\hat q,\hat p]=i\hbar$ and that (b) the exact pauli algebra is not necessary for arriving at a violation.
%This evaluation was meant to illuminate that the source of violation essentially hinges on $[\hat{q},\hat{p}]=i\hbar$. It is apparent that the complete pauli algebra is unnecessary for showing a violation. 


%\subsection{Advantage of asymmetry in $\hat{X}$ and $\hat{Z}$}
%Thus while our construction is motivated by the spin formalism, it is not just a relabelling of states and operators achieved by a severe restriction of the Hilbert space. 


\section{Physical Implementation \label{physicalImplementation}}
\begin{figure*}
%\resizebox{15cm}{!}{\input{diagrams/scheme.pdftex_t}}
\includegraphics[width=17cm]{plots/scheme.pdf}
\caption{Scheme for creating the state\label{fig:scheme}}
\end{figure*}

The test can be implemented in a quantum interferometric setups using grating technique to create a multicomponent superposition states as is used in matter wave experiments for instance. 
We show that this scheme can be implemented using photons. We harness the two degrees of freedom of a photon, it's polarization and it's spatial degree of freedom to construct the required state. With a slightly modified setup, it is possible to do the same with spin and position
for matter waves (see \subref{c7}). The final setup is given in \figref{scheme}. We need only consider the quantum mechanical description along the $x$-axis.

\subsection{Creation of the entangled state}

The desired entangled state is $\ket{\Psi}$, as stated in \eq{entangledState}. 
We start with noting the triviality of constructing a $\ket{\psi_{+}}$
%\[\left|\psi_{+}\right\rangle =\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{n\inI_{N}}\left|\varphi_{n}\right\rangle \]
 state (see \eq{eqn:psipm}). Consider a source that produces a state $\ket{\gamma}$ at the grating. $\braket{q | \gamma}$ is assumed to be a real Gaussian with $\sigma\gg 2NL$. The grating has $N$ slits of width $a\ll L$, separated by a distance $L$ (centre to centre). After the grating, we obtain $\ket{\psi_+}=G\ket{\gamma}$. Similarly the $\ket{\psi_{-}}$
%\[\left|\psi_{-}\right\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{n\inI_{N}}\left(-1\right)^{n+1}\left|\varphi_{n}\right\rangle\]
 state can be constructed by using glass slabs at alternate slits, such that the phase introduced is $\pi$. %\,\implies\, e^{i\pi}=-1$. 
In \figref{scheme}, if you consider only one particle, and disregard
everything after the grating, then the setup is expected to produce a $\left|\psi_{+}\right\rangle $ state, right after it. To produce the desired entangled state, we start with two entangled photons, such that their polarization state can be expressed as $\ket{\chi} \equiv \frac{ \ket{H}_1\ket{V}_2 -\ket{V}_1\ket{H}_2 }{\sqrt{2}}$. Their spatial description (along $x$-axis) is initially assumed to be $\ket{\gamma}_1 \ket{\gamma}_2$ so that the post grating state is

%The state $\left|\gamma\right\rangle $ maybe considered to be a Gaussian with $\sigma\gg2NL$ so that after the grating, the spatial state can be written as 
\[
\frac{ \ket{H}_1\ket{V}_2 -\ket{V}_1\ket{H}_2 }{\sqrt{2}} \ket{\psi_+}_1\ket{\psi_+}_2
\]
%To produce a $\left|\psi_{-}\right\rangle $ state, we already know we needed alternate glass slabs. 
If we had glass slabs, whose refractive index (given some orientation) was say $\eta_{H}=1$ for a horizontally polarized beam and $\eta_{V}=\eta\neq1$ for vertical polarization to create the interaction Hamiltonian of the form $\proj{V}\hat Z$, then we could harness the entangled polarization state to create the required spatially entangled state. Birefringent crystals have such polarization dependent refractive indices. Assume that alternating birefringent crystals have been placed after both the gratings with appropriate thickness so that %Their widths to cause $\pi$ . %as shown in \figref{scheme} (in the diagram, they're not alternating for reasons to follow). 
%These also have appropriate widths to introduce a $\pi$ phase. 
the subsequent state is

\[
\frac{\ket{H}_1\ket{V}_2\ket{\psi_+}_1\ket{\psi_-}_2 - \ket{V}_1\ket{H}_2\ket{\psi_-}_1\ket{\psi_+}_2}{\sqrt 2} 
\]
If the polarization state is traced out, the resultant state will be mixed, hence useless. %Ignoring the glass slabs at the moment in \figref{scheme}, we observe the action of the polarisers on the state. 
Instead, a $45^{\circ}$ polariser is introduced after which (see \subref{c8}) the target entangled state
\[
\ket{\chi_{45}}\ket{\Psi} = \ket{\nearrow}_1\ket{\nearrow}_2 \frac{\ket{\psi_+}_1\ket{\psi_-}_2 - \ket{\psi_-}_1\ket{\psi_+}_2}{\sqrt 2}
\]
is obtained, where $\left|\nearrow\right\rangle \equiv\left(\left|H\right\rangle +\left|V\right\rangle \right)/\sqrt{2}$. As a remark, it maybe be stated that although to arrive at this result we assumed that $\eta_{H}=1$, which is unreasonable physically, we can compensate for $\eta_{H}\neq1$ by putting appropriate glass slabs at the alternate empty slits, to produce zero relative phase when the polarization is horizontal.




\subsection{Measurement Settings}

The measurement setting is applied by local unitaries like $\hat U(\theta)\otimes \hat U(\phi)$. A local unitary can be performed by placing alternating glass slabs of widths such that \eq{eqn:U} holds. These slabs may be placed right after the birefringent crystals, before the polarizer. 
The final state just after the polarizer is given by $\left|\Psi_{\theta\phi}\right\rangle=\hat U(\theta)\otimes \hat U(\phi)\left|\Psi\right\rangle $, where $\theta\phi$ is used to index which of the four possible measurement settings was used.  %$\ket{\psi_0}\to e^{i\theta/2}\ket{\psi_0}$ and $\ket{\psi_1}\to e^{-i\theta/2}\ket{\psi_1}$.

%In our scheme, Alice and Bob can choose between $\phi,\phi'$ and $\theta,\theta'$ respectively. To implement this, we recall that the action of $\hat{U}(\theta)$, is to introduce a phase difference between the $\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle $ and $\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle $ states. By construction, $\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle $ and $\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle $ are spatially disjoint; thus the operation of $\hat{U}(\theta)$ can be implemented by simply placing alternating glass slabs at the slits, with widths such that $\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle \to e^{i\theta/2}\left|\psi_{0}\right\rangle $ and $\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle \to e^{-i\theta/2}\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle $. The same operation maybe done for $\hat{U}(\phi)$ for the second particle. In the overall scheme, %as shown in \figref{scheme}, this is can be done by placing glass slabs right after the birefringent crystals. 


\subsection{Effective Practical Setup}

Placing glass slabs may not be suitable for fine gratings, although a similar setup maybe possible\cite{Farias15}. Practically we can implement the same scheme using the setup shown in \figref{scheme}. %First we note that only relative phases between $\ket{\psi_0}$ and $\ket{\psi_1}$ are essential. 
The first large slab is a Birefringent crystal ($\eta_H,\eta_V$) while the adjacent slab is plain glass ($\eta$). We generate longitudenal standing pressure waves so that the effective thickness at alternate grating sites are given by $d_0,d_1$ and $t_0,t_1$ for the crystal and slab respectively. The phase difference between a horiztonal $\ket{\psi_0}$ and $\ket{\psi_1}$ will be given by $\eta_H(d_0 - d_1)\equiv \theta_A$; note that physically only phase differences are essential. For the vertical component, it'll be $\eta_V(d_0-d_1)$. If we impose $\eta_V(d_0-d_1)=\pi+\theta_A$, then we would've created\footnote{upto an overall phase} the state
 \[ e^{i\hat Z \frac{\theta_A}{2}}\frac{\ket{\psi_+} + \ket{\psi_-}}{\sqrt{2}} \]
for an incident $\frac{\ket{H}+\ket{V}}{\sqrt{2}}$ polarization state. $d_0$ and $d_1$ will be constrained by some relation depending on physical properties of the crystal; they'll also depend on the amplitude of the longitudenal wave. From this and the imposed constrain, $d_0,d_1$ and the corresponding amplitude can be determined. However, we haven't the freedom to change $\theta_A$. To remedy this, we use the glass slab. It will introduce an additional relative phase $\eta(t_0-t_1)\equiv \theta_B$. Here, again $t_0,t_1$, may satisfy some constraint, but will depend on the amplitude which is adjustable. Thus, by changing this amplitude, we can set the relative phase $\theta=\theta_A+\theta_B$ arbitrarily.

Effectively therefore, this scheme allows for both creation of the entangled state and changing the measurement settings in a practical way.


\subsection{Measurement}

The scheme requires us to evaluate the correlation functions such as $\mean{\hat{X}(\theta)\otimes\hat{X}(\phi)}$. Equivalently, the measurement settings can be chosen by applying the corresponding local
unitaries  on the entangled state, that is $\ket{\Psi_{\theta\phi}}=\hat U(\theta)\otimes\hat U(\phi)\ket{\Psi}$. Therefore, obtaining $\left|\left\langle p{}_{1},p{}_{2}|\Psi_{\theta \phi}\right\rangle \right|^{2}$ is sufficient for evaluating % $\braket{ \hat{X}\otimes\hat{X} } =\left\langle \cos(\hat{p}L/\hbar)\otimes\cos(\hat{p}L/\hbar)\right\rangle $
 $\braket{ \hat{X}(\theta)\otimes\hat{X} (\phi)} = \int dp{}_{1}dp{}_{2}\cos(p{}_{1}L/\hbar)\cos(p{}_{2}L/\hbar)\left|\left\langle p{}_{1},p{}_{2}|\Psi_{\theta\phi}\right\rangle \right|^{2}$. 

It is known that in the far-field approximation\cite{Gneiting13},
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:measure}
\left| \braket{p_1=\frac{p_zq_1}{D},p_2=\frac{p_zq_2}{D}|\Psi_{\theta\phi}} \right|^2=\dfrac{D^2}{p_z^2} \left| \braket{q_1,q_2 | \Psi_{\theta\phi\text{ screen}}} \right|^2
\end{equation}
 where $\left|\Psi{}_{\theta\phi\,\text{screen}}\right\rangle $ is the state of the system at the screen, $D$ is the distance between the gratings
and the screens and $p_{z}$ is the $z$ component of momentum of the particle. For a photon, $p_{z}=h/\lambda$ while for a massive particle with mass $m$, $p_{z}=mD/T$, where $T$ is the time taken to arrive at the screen from the grating (see, Fig. \ref{fig:scheme}). The idea is simply that the momentum distribution at the grating can be recovered by observing the spatial distribution at the screen, sufficiently far away.

\section{Conclusion and outlook}
In the present work, we constructed a new Bell-operator in terms of phase space measurement via modular variables. In this particular scheme there is no possibility for bipartite system with  positive definite Wigner function, formally entangled or not, to yield a violation of the inequality. Therefore, a violation of the inequality truly demonstrate the contradiction with local (hidden) phase space model as apposed to other approaches \cite{Parity98, Chen02} using sharp quantum measurement with no classical analog. The measurement observables in our scheme are very simple with a clear classical limit. The relevant entangled states used for achieving a violation of the inequality however required creation of multi-component superposition states through grating with enough number of slits. 

It is obvious from the properties of the modular variables used, that the violation is larger for higher number of slits. One can however imagine that those entangled states created with slits fewer than the minimum number needed for obtaining a violation, must also hold nonlocal properties. To reveal the nonlocality in this range one may need more optimal observables than those considered here.

\subsubsection{Action of $\hat{q}_{\text{mod}2L}$ can be defined explicitly\label{sub:c6}}

Proof: $\hat{q}_{\text{mod}2L}\equiv\int dqq{}_{\text{mod}2L}\left|q\right\rangle \left\langle q\right|$.
To arrive at this more carefully, consider the operator $e^{i\hat{q}\frac{2\pi}{2L}}$.
Note that $e^{i\hat{q}\frac{2\pi}{2L}}\left|q\right\rangle =e^{iq\frac{2\pi}{2L}}\left|q\right\rangle =e^{iq{}_{\text{mod}2L}\frac{2\pi}{2L}}\left|q\right\rangle $.
Thus, $\hat{q}_{\text{mod}2L}\left|q\right\rangle =q{}_{\text{mod}2L}\left|q\right\rangle $,
consequently on the most general state $\left|f\right\rangle \equiv\int dqf_{q}\left|q\right\rangle $
then, we'd have $\hat{q}_{\text{mod}2L}\left|f\right\rangle =\int dqf_{q}q{}_{\text{mod}2L}\left|q\right\rangle $. 

Remark: One needn't necessarily consider eigenstates of $\hat{q}$
to define the action. Eigenstates of $e^{i\hat{q}\frac{2\pi}{2L}}$
maybe considered instead; they can be expressed as (a) $\left|\varphi\right\rangle ,\, s.t.\,\left\langle p+\frac{h}{2L}|\varphi\right\rangle =\left\langle p|\varphi\right\rangle ,\,\forall\, p\in\mathbb{R}$
or (b) $\left|\bar{q}\right\rangle \propto\sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}\left|\bar{q}+n2L\right\rangle $.
Using the second expression, we have $e^{i\hat{q}\frac{2\pi}{2L}}\left|\bar{q}\right\rangle =e^{i\bar{q}\frac{2\pi}{2L}}\left|\bar{q}\right\rangle $.
Thus on a more general state, $\left|c\right\rangle \equiv\int_{0}^{2L}d\bar{q}c_{\bar{q}}\left|\bar{q}\right\rangle $,
we have $\hat{q}_{\text{mod}2L}\left|c\right\rangle =\int_{0}^{2L}d\bar{q}c_{\bar{q}}\bar{q}\left|\bar{q}\right\rangle $.

\subsubsection{Physical implementation with electrons is also possible\label{sub:c7}}

If we can show that the basic components used to describe the photon
setup can be translated to the electron setup, then in principle we
are through. (a) Glass slab: The equivalent is the electric AB effect.
We need to simply put a capacitor after the slit and the two components
will pick up a phase difference. (b) Polariser: The Stern Gerlach
setup is the classic analogue. We simply block the orthogonal component.
(c) Birefringent crystal: This is slightly tricky. It can be modelled
by using a combination of gradient of magnetic field (as in Stern
Gerlach) and a capacitor. We start with an equivalent superposition
of spin states, $\frac{\left|\uparrow\downarrow\right\rangle -\left|\downarrow\uparrow\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}\left|\psi_{+}\psi_{+}\right\rangle $.
To construct the spin dependent $\left|\psi_{-}\right\rangle $ state,
we use the magnetic field gradient to spatially separate the $\left|\uparrow\right\rangle $
and $\left|\downarrow\right\rangle $ states. We place capacitors
as described at the spatial position corresponding to $\left|\downarrow\right\rangle $
say. Thereafter, we remove the magnetic field gradient and allow the
beams to meet again. This will effectively act as a Birefringent crystal,
since the phase difference is spin dependent.


\subsubsection{Action of a polariser\label{sub:c8}}

If we define $\left|\nearrow\right\rangle \equiv\frac{\left|H\right\rangle +\left|V\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}},$
$\left|\nwarrow\right\rangle \equiv-\frac{\left|H\right\rangle -\left|V\right\rangle }{\sqrt{2}}$
and the $45^{\circ}$ projector as $\left|\nearrow\right\rangle \left\langle \nearrow\right|$,
then both $\left|H\right\rangle \to\left|\nearrow\right\rangle $ and $\left|V\right\rangle \to\left|\nearrow\right\rangle$
where ofcourse with a probability $1/2$, the photon will be lost.


\subsubsection{More on measurement\label{sub:c9}}

% \end{figure}

It is essential to know what ballpark resolution is required for detecting the violation from the screen. We note
\[
\ab{\braket{p_1, p_2 | \Psi_f}}=\ab{\tilde{\varphi}(p_1) \tilde{\varphi}(p_2) F_f(p_1,p_2)}
\]
where
\begin{align*}
F_f(p_1,p_2)&=\frac{1}{\sqrt 2} \sum_{(n,m)\in I_N \otimes I_N} e^{i(np_1 + mp_2)L/\hbar} \\
& \left[ -\cos(\delta') [(-)^m - (-)^n] + i \sin(\delta') [1 + (-)^{n+m}] \right]
\end{align*}

$\tilde{\varphi}(p) \equiv \braket{p|\varphi}$ and $\delta' = (\phi - \theta)/2$. Here the information about $\delta'$ is contained in $f$, and $N$ is known from $\ket{\Psi}$. Since the wavefunction $\varphi(q)$ was assumed sharp with respect to $L$, $\ab{ \tilde \varphi(p)}$ will only correspond to a broad envelope, over the range $(-Nh/2L,Nh/2L)$. Thus the main feature of $\ab{\braket{p_1,p_2,\Psi_f}}^2$ will be given by $\ab{F_f}$ as shown in \fig{fig:scheme}. Graphically it is clear that a resolution of say $0.1p_{\text{typ}}=0.1\frac{h}{L}$ should be sufficient to capture the relevant features. On the screen, this translates to a typical length, $q_{\text{typ}}=\lambda D /L$ which follows from \eq{eqn:measure} and $p_z=h/\lambda$ for a photon. This is reminiscent of typical diffraction experiments and is in units that're readily measurable.
