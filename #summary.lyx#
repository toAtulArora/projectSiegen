\begin_layout Subsection
Impressions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I started with reading about Modular Variables from `Dynamical quantum non-local
ity', a perspective paper from Nature Physics.
 The paper basically talks about how modular variables capture the essence
 of a quantum state in a way that no other variable we've considered so
 far does.
 It relates this to non-locality in quantum mechanics.
 This non-locality however is not the one usually considered in the context
 of say the singlet state.
 The point they make is that this non-locality arises from the equations
 of motion (Heisenberg picture), which are non-local themselves (since operators
 are involved).
 I found the paper is simple, subtle and interesting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Next I started reading a paper titled `Quantum interference experiments,
 modular variables and weak measurements' from IOP Science.
 This I was told is an elaboration of the perspective paper.
 However, I didn't complete this for I hadn't frozen the topic yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I talked to a person named `Roope' at the group and his work came across
 as rather fascinating.
 I was impressed by his work; it is related to `measurement equivalent of
 mixed state'.
 You make a certain kind of measurment with a certain classical probability.
 With this type of measruement operators, he was able to show that for compatibl
ity, commutation is not the best criterion.
 Of course compatability means that the two measurement can be done simultaneous
ly without affecting each other.
 He gave a good example from his paper `Joint Measureablity of Generalized
 Measruements Implies Classicality', PRL to illustrate the points.
 His main result was unification of the concept of steering with that of
 his test of joint measurement, viz.
 compatibility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Modular variables are discussed quite neatly in the book by Aharonov et.
 al., titled `Quantm Paradoxes: Quantum Theory for the Perplexed'.
 I read the first few pages, which are a delight to read (about how paradoxes
 help, classification of paradoxes etc.).
 I read the main chapter related to modular variables.
 I still have some small doubts which I'll clarify soon.
 Other than that, I have a good basic idea of the concept.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I talked to `Costentino' who basically told me that his work revolves around
 looking at Bells inequalities in more complicated systems.
 I didn't find that particularly attractive.
 I also talked to `Nicolai' and he told me he works on finding interesting
 states.
 The kind of states he/they look for are such that the sub systems (partially
 traced) are separable but the entire state is `genuinely entangled' (this
 is the region of state space excluding separable and after tracing entangled
 states).
 He talked about witnesses and an algorithm to find an optimal witness and
 an optimal state correspondingly, recursively, starting from a random initial
 state matrix.
 This was ok, but again, not very appealing to me.
 And last person for the (that) day, I talked to `Marius' and he told me
 about how he studies bell's inequalities in decaying particles, and his
 system of choice was Kions.
 Again, it maybe non trivial and hard, but didn't come accross as worth
 pursuing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Discussed various topics with Roope including
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
How contextuality is expected from usual understanding of QM, but it is
 essential to characterize the quantum feature of the system (later Dr.
 Guehne explained how in Bell's case, local hidden variable is the assumption,
 whereas here, the assumption is non-contextuality [since we're talking
 about only one system])
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Discussed how one can exponentiate an unbounded operator.
 He seemed to have some big mathematical machinary, but I am still not convinced
 that it is necessary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I wasn't able to understand how to prove (especially after the new definition
 of exponentiation) 
\begin_inset Formula $[e^{A},e^{B}]=0\implies[A,B]=0$
\end_inset

.
 We tried some things, but they didn't help much.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Implementing causality etc.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Maria: She works on hypergraph states.
 The idea is to represent quantum states as graphs.
 One can show the limits of usual graphs of this form.
 The limit is that one can represent say the GHZ state, but not a related
 less entagled state (forgot the name).
 She had made a lot of new progress in barely 3 months.
 She found states which maximally violate the bell inequality in 3 qubits,
 which weren't known earlier.
 She was able to even derive conditions on probablities of certain outcomes
 which consequently rule out various local hidden variable models.
 In the course of doing this, she'd made various conjectures and proven
 them, by looking at patterns in certain calculations.
 I found her work rather interesting and impressive, given that she did
 it all in barely 3 months (and that she is/was a computer science student),
 but not something I'd pursue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Frank: He started with explaining various usual quantum optics subtopics,
 such as action of a beam splitter in terms of creation anhilation operators,
 how its action is similar to that of CNOT, how it can easily convert superposit
ion to entanglement, how a coherent state would pass through it etc.
 Then he mentioned what's called a P distribution, (stands for P something
 and Sudarshan distribution) which is given for a state 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{\rho}(\alpha)$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\in C$
\end_inset

, and s.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=\int P_{\rho}(\alpha)\left|\alpha\right\rangle \left\langle \alpha\right|$
\end_inset

.
 This he said is more useful in characterizing quantum properties.
 Then he discussed how like in the one qubit case, we have a bloch sphere,
 we can construct similar objects with more qubits also.
 Then he talked about relating 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\alpha\right\rangle =D(\alpha)\left|0\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 with creating states from the extremum state, like 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|j,j\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 by applying similarly constructed 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 equivalents, except in this case with 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{\pm}$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $a,\, a^{\dagger}$
\end_inset

.
 He claimed that the states in the orbit of this group (group of transformations
), don't span the full space.
 He said that mixed states so produced can then be mapped to entangled state
 like was done with the beam splitter.
 The details he said are involving.
 This also looked interesting, but again, not the direction in which I'd
 like to work at the moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Return of Ali
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Read chapter five with a microscope, the way I usually read.
 I came accross various difficulties consequently.
 One of them was the fact that they seem to have shown that if we assume
 a periodic potential and apply perturbation, then the angle of diffraction
 must correspond to that of a maxima.
 Else the probability of an electron having any other momenta vanishes.
 Spent a lot of time reading the first section properly, but it isn't quite
 worth it, it seemed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Ali had returned and I sat and explained to him what it is that I had read
 in the days he wasn't here.
 He said he'll be away next week again for another conference.
 In any case, I explained to him the theme of chapter 4.
 It had to do with the Aharonov Bohm effect; this relates the gauge freedom
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $(V,\vec{A})$
\end_inset

 with that of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 to be overall gauge invariant.
 This consequently shows up as a phase in an interference experiment.
 The important thing again is that the interaction is non-local (the EM
 field is zero where the electrons are present).
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Next I tried to explain to him the details as given the book, but it was
 soon concluded that it is not a very good idea to continue in that direction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
He then described his work on exploiting the relation of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $D(x)D(p)=e^{i\text{some phase}}D(x+ip)$
\end_inset

 to get non local effects.
 He talked about how plotting wigner functions help visualize the interference
 patterns etc.
 and then went on to talk about doing bell type tests on these.
 He has written Phys Rev papers on these topics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Finally, he showed me some work that he had started working on, but hadn't
 completed which he feels is new and can be a good project for me to extend/esta
blish.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Finally, I was convinced that to understand various settings, I must be
 able to visualize, which requires MATLAB.
 Unfortunately or fortunately, MATLAB wasn't available on the computer and
 neither was Marius
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Then I thought of some ideas related to observing nonlocal effects etc.
 No good though.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
May 18 - 23 [week 2]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Multiple Clarifications and Ambiguities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The contextuality assumption is not equivalent to the assumption of determinism
 [this clarification was due to Otfried]
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The idea is that there can be deterministic contextuality.
 My claim was that if this is so, then it must violate causality.
 The counter was based on an explicit construction.
 The idea was simply that the contextuality can be based on the past and
 doesn't have to rely on the future.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Let's quickly understand this.
 Assume the following matrix of observables, such that along a column all
 observables can be measured simultanesouly.
 Similarly, along the row all observables can be measured simultanesouly.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
A & B & C\\
a & b & c\\
\alpha & \beta & \gamma
\end{array}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
My argument was that if the assignment is deterministic and contextual,
 then say 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 has a value depending on the context.
 However, say I just measure 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and nothing else at the moment.
 Since the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 had to depend on the context, which I haven't picked yet, therefore it
 is equivalently the statement that the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 depended on a future event.
 Which is in clear violation of causality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This is countered by constructing an explicit example.
 I say that say I picked 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 next.
 Eventually I pick 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

.
 Now the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 will depend on the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 had been chosen to start with.
 The context is created by the past, not the future.
 Apprently something called Mealy machines can be constructed which use
 memory of the kind, which measurement was made and violate the inequality
 set by assuming non-contextuality
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Conclusion: Non contextuality is a stronger condition than determinism,
 which is violated.
 Which means that we still haven't ruled out deterministic contextual theories.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The claim that there're no observables that measure the phase in the expression
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left|\psi\right\rangle =\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle +e^{i\phi}\left|\psi_{2}\right\rangle 
\]

\end_inset

subjected to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \psi_{1}\right|\left|\psi_{2}\right\rangle =0$
\end_inset

 was challenged by the following [this was due to Zanna]
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
One could take each of these through a fibre optic and measure its phase
 wrt another reference laser and find the phase difference OR one could
 shine a third light 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi_{3}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and look at the interference it produces.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi_{3}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is assumed to s.t.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \psi_{i}\right|\left|\psi_{3}\right\rangle \neq0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in\{1,2\}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This is a serious issue because it had been proven that no moment of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 can be dependent on 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 and therefore (ignoring for the moment infinite series etc.) 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 should not be observable.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
I further realized a crisis in the understanding of the word 
\emph on
non local dynamics
\emph default
.
 I initiated reading (fortunately or unfortunately) the paper titled `Quantum
 interference experiments, modular variables and weak measruements'.
 It does seem to have
